# Dependency graph report

```sh
pnpm depgraph                       # -> .tmp/depgraph/graph.json + a text summary
pnpm depgraph --out /tmp/graph.json
pnpm depgraph:test
```

Emits the dependency graph of every production file under `src/` (tests excluded) as JSON,
plus a short summary of what the layering gate does not enforce. There is no renderer: the
productive artifact is the JSON, queried directly.

## Blast radius of one file

```sh
pnpm depgraph affected packages/host-kit/src/command.ts # bounded text
pnpm depgraph affected src/daemon/ref-frame.ts --json --limit 25
```

Reverse reachability over the value-edge graph, plus the three lookups that used to follow it:
the `scripts/check-affected/` gate plan for the dependent set, the public commands whose handler
chain reaches the file (value + dynamic edges, because handlers load through `import()`) with
their owning live iOS scenarios when that manifest is in the tree, and the ADR 0011
guarantee-matrix cells the file implements. See docs/agents/testing.md § "Before editing a shared
module".

## When to reach for this

It pays for itself on three questions, and misleads on a fourth.

**"What am I about to break?"** `nodes[].in` is the dependent count — blast radius. Size the
nodes by dependents and the files you should touch carefully are the big ones. Faster than
grepping, and it counts type-only and dynamic edges that a grep for `from '...'` misses.

**"Where is the debt actually concentrated?"** Zone-level counts (`zoneEdges`) answer "which
boundary carries the most traffic" in one query. The pass that produced ADR-adjacent findings
started here.

**"What is wrong that the gate does not enforce?"** This is the part CI cannot give you. The
gate rejects value-import cycles (R4) and spine back-edges (R5); the graph additionally reports:

- **value edges whose target is also reachable at distance >= 2** — static module reachability,
  and *only* that. It is **not** a removability claim, and the obvious reading is wrong:
  reachability does not carry bindings (if `a` imports `{ c }` while `b` only re-exports it as
  `{ c as b }`, the path exists and deleting `a -> c` still breaks `a`), it does not preserve when
  a module's side effects run, and a direct import is often deliberately clearer than reaching
  through a barrel. Deciding whether any given edge can go needs symbol-level analysis this does
  not attempt. ~1300 of them: a place to look, never a work list.
- **type-only and dynamic cycles** — 8 of them, all outside R4 by design (a type-only import is
  free at runtime, a dynamic one is a deliberate cold-start seam). Worth reading when a module
  feels hard to reason about.

**Where it misleads: a cluster's size is not its difficulty.** This is worth stating plainly
because it already cost a day. The `commands -> client` cluster looked like the obvious win — 28
type-only inversions, all pointing at one file. Moving that file down took the gate from **42 to
48**, because the vocabulary it holds *depends on* `commands/`, `metro/`, `core/` and `remote/`;
declaring it in `contracts/` made the foundation depend on the layers above it. The picture shows
you an edge's weight, not whether it can be reversed.

So: use the render to find a candidate, then answer "can this move?" numerically before planning
anything. The question is always *what does the target itself import, and what rank is that?*

```sh
pnpm depgraph
# Zone pairs that invert the ranked spine. Read `typeInversions` rather than deriving it from
# `zoneEdges`: those counts come from the COLLAPSED edge list, where one edge per file pair
# survives and `dynamic` outranks `type`, so a module imported both lazily and for its types
# would drop out. `typeInversions` is counted by the gate's own rule.
node -e "const j=require('./.tmp/depgraph/graph.json');
  Object.entries(j.typeInversions)
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .forEach(([pair, n]) => console.log(String(n).padStart(4), pair));"
```


Note `zoneEdges[].backEdge` flags **R5 value** back-edges only, and there are none — filtering on
it returns an empty list, which is the gate passing, not a broken query.


## What is authoritative

`pnpm check:layering` is. The report reads the same model (`scripts/layering/model.ts`) and applies
the gate's own counting rule — `typeInversionsByPair` counts once per file pair over the raw edges,
exactly as `typeInversionCounts` in `scripts/layering/model.ts` does — so `typeInversions` reproduces
the gate's R6 measurement by construction, not by a second measurement. The gate compares that
measurement with the merge-base's; CI used to assert the report agreed with a recorded baseline,
which was a duplicate detector of the same code path and was removed. In particular the count
does NOT come from the collapsed edge list, where `dynamic` outranks `type` and a module imported
both lazily and for its types would drop out.

If the report ever disagrees with the gate, the gate is right.

## Why it reuses the layering gate

The graph is extracted with `scripts/layering/model.ts`, the same module
`scripts/layering/check.ts` uses in CI. File set, zone partition, edge kinds
(value / type-only / dynamic), and cycle definition are therefore identical to the rules
the gate enforces — a separate extractor with its own resolution behaviour would draw a
graph nobody is enforcing. Cross-checked once against `dependency-cruiser` 3.1.1 (at the commit it was written): same
modules and edges, plus 88 dynamic/type-only edges dependency-cruiser fails to resolve.

## What the JSON carries

- `zones[]` — id, spine `rank` (`null` when intentionally unranked), `classification`, file
  count, LOC.
- `zoneEdges[]` — per zone pair: total `count`, `valueCount`, and `backEdge` (R5 value
  back-edges only — see the note above).
- `nodes[]` — per file: zone index, LOC, `in`/`out` degree, `lvl` (longest path to a sink over
  value edges; R4 guarantees that subgraph is a DAG), and `cyc` (index into `cycles`, or `-1`).
- `edges[]` — index-addressed `[from, to, kind, flags]`. Kind: `0` value, `1` type-only, `2`
  dynamic. Flags bitfield: `1` spine back-edge, `2` target also reachable at distance >= 2, `4` type-only
  inversion.
- `cycles[]` — each with `kind` (`value` / `type` / `dynamic`) and its node path.

## Declared-authority overlay

The report also carries `edgeAuthorities[]`, aligned with `edges[]`. Each entry is a compact list
of labels, so a collapsed edge may carry more than one label. The labels are derived from exact
roots, exports, and named live-state symbols in `scripts/layering/architecture-ownership.ts`:

- `vocabulary` — the target is a declared contract facade root.
- `capability` — the target is a declared capability root and the import names a declared export.
- `live-state-shape` — the edge names the exact `SessionState` type from `src/daemon/session-state.ts`.
- `live-state-authority` — the edge names the exact `SessionStore` class from
  `src/daemon/session-store.ts`.
- `executable-policy` — the source is under a declared executable-policy root.
- `ordinary` — no declared authority evidence matches the edge.

`edges[][2]` remains the independent import-kind code (`0` value, `1` type-only, `2` dynamic), and
`authorityCounts` reports stable counts of labels across the collapsed edges. This is a report-only
overlay: it reports declared authority, not behavioral ownership quality, safe removability, or a
composite score/pass threshold.

For reproducible inspection outside the repository's `.tmp` directory:

```sh
pnpm depgraph --out /tmp/agent-device-2128-depgraph.json
jq '{generated, authorityCounts}' /tmp/agent-device-2128-depgraph.json
jq -r '
  . as $graph
  | range(0; ($graph.edges | length)) as $i
  | select($graph.edgeAuthorities[$i] != ["ordinary"])
  | [($graph.edgeAuthorities[$i] | join("+")),
     $graph.nodes[$graph.edges[$i][0]].id,
     $graph.nodes[$graph.edges[$i][1]].id,
     ["value", "type", "dynamic"][$graph.edges[$i][2]]]
  | @tsv
' /tmp/agent-device-2128-depgraph.json
```

Bit `2` means the target is reachable from the source at distance >= 2 over value edges. That is
module reachability, not removability — see the caveats above. Treat it as a question ("why is
this imported directly as well?"), never as an instruction.

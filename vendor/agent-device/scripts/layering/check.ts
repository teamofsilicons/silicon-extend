// Import-direction lint — enforces the folder DAG established by the Phase-5
// folder moves. The policies and their tests below are the source of truth.
//
// Ranked target spine, as rank groups lowest to highest. `A ◄ B` means B may not
// be outranked by A (the back-edge order the gate rejects), NOT that every displayed import exists:
//   { contracts, request, selectors } ◄ core ◄ commands
//         ◄ { client, daemon-server } ◄ daemon-client ◄ cli
// (authoritative ranks: `TARGET_DAG_RANK` in model.ts. The former rank-0 kernel
// zone lives in packages/kernel since #1490 W0; R11 owns its boundary.)
// `commands/schema/` renders the rest of commands/'s facets and reads them; commands never
// imports it back (#2543). It shares the commands zone (#2679 folded the standalone
// cli-schema zone into it), so the ranked spine and the R2 zone-policy table cannot see the
// edge — `commands-schema-boundary.ts` enforces the direction as a folder-scoped rule instead.
//
// This gate enforces five things, across four scopes:
//   - GLOBALLY, across every production source file: the remaining R2 move rule and
//     rejection of all production static value-import cycles (R4). R1 kernel-sink
//     retired with the kernel's move to packages/kernel (#1490 W0); R8
//     zero-dep-job-closure retired with the last `install-deps: false` job
//     (#1781 A6) — its invariant has no subjects. R14 is reserved for the terminal
//     src/utils retirement rule (#2149); other new rules take the next free id.
//   - Over the RANKED SPINE only: rejection of every spine back-edge (R5), i.e.
//     an import whose source zone outranks its target zone, plus a ratchet on the
//     same inversion measured over TYPE-ONLY edges (R6).
//   - Over the DAEMON only: SessionState field ownership (R7), because the session
//     record is store-owned mutable state that any daemon module can write; and the terminal
//     concrete-platform boundary (R65), which rejects every import form into the retired
//     src/platforms path or a platform package.
//   - Over the TYPE GRAPH: the largest type-level import cycle may not grow past the
//     merge-base (R9). R4 keeps the value graph acyclic, so these cycles are free at
//     runtime but bound what can be read in isolation.
//   - Across the DAEMON MODULARITY MIGRATION: R7 ownership pressure and external
//     daemon request/session-state importers only shrink, R9 zone membership cannot grow or absorb
//     engine files, and planned logical modules start with zero forbidden/internal imports (R10).
//   - Over the WORKSPACE PACKAGES: no root back-imports, no relative tunnelling past
//     an exports map, and every workspace specifier declared + exports-named (R11).
//   - Over PLATFORM PACKAGE COMPOSITION: six private metadata façades meet at the exact root
//     composition file; premature implementation loading and forbidden cross-boundary edges fail (R13).
//   - Over THE APPLE RUNNER SUBTREE: `runner/**` may not value-import `@agent-device/host-kit/*`
//     directly (R77) — the subtree sits in the eager closure of seven Apple façade entries the
//     eager-closure-budgets gate holds at a fixed size, so a direct host-kit edge grows all seven;
//     host-kit reaches the runner only through `runner/host.ts`, bound in `core/runner-host.ts`.
//   - Over SIMCTL ARGV in production source: `tsc` holds `runXcrun` and the Apple tool port to
//     branded simctl argv. The plain executors take any string argv, so R79 refuses every array
//     that names simctl first outside `core/simctl.ts` and `core/tool-provider.ts`, however it
//     reaches an executor, holds an inline xcrun argv to a literal non-simctl tool name, and keeps
//     brand casts inside those two modules, so a udid never runs outside the set that holds it.
//   - Over REQUEST-BOUND RUNTIME EXECUTION: facts remain the only admission authority and daemon
//     code cannot manufacture or repair a narrowed runtime proof (R66).
//   - Over CONTRACTS PRODUCTION SOURCE: contracts owns vocabulary only — host, process, and timer
//     mechanics belong in capture-kit or an adapter (R18).
// R6, R9, and the R10 R7 counts are ratchets with no written-down reference: each is the same
// measurement taken over the merge-base with origin/main (`ratchet-reference.ts`), so growth
// fails, a shrink needs no edit, and no change can bank headroom.
// `(root)` holds entrypoints and composition roots. The retired `src/utils` zone is deliberately
// outside the spine and is rejected separately by R14; extracted workspace package zones are
// classified separately and held behind R11 instead of the src folder spine.

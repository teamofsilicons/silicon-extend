// from src/daemon/session-store.ts, at symbol level so that a file importing only helper
// functions from session-store.ts is not an authority edge. R7 already owns the write side
// (field ownership); this overlay owns the read side. The shape target is found by the
// declaration, not a recorded path: a path constant would silently measure zero shape importers
// the moment the declaration moves (#2346 moved it from types.ts to session-state.ts). The
// ratchet applies to the handler-owned subset — the flat src/daemon/handlers/ surface the
// #2132 migration targeted — and is a membership ratchet against the merge-base: the set may
// only shrink, so a handler file gaining state-shape or store authority fails instead of
// silently regrowing the hotspot.

 * Catches: the handler-owned SessionState-shape / SessionStore-authority surface regrowing —
 *   a file under src/daemon/handlers/ importing either symbol that the merge-base does not
 *   already import it, which is exactly the deep-import the #2132 migration paid to delete.
 *   Both overlays are full-scope; the handler-owned subset is filtered here, at the single
 *   place the ratchet applies it, so the message can never name a file outside its scope.
 * Evidence: #2132's completion record (2026-09-02) moved handler-owned shape edges 55 -> 16
 *   and authority edges 50 -> 23 and left the residue to a fresh authority audit; #2278 ran
 *   that audit at origin/main 6e22e266d7 and measured 14/22 handler-owned (112/68
 *   repo-wide), classified in ADR 0022.
 * Cost: attributed to the R75 rule registration in check.ts; the measurement is folded into
 *   measureRatchets (ratchet-reference.ts), so the reference tree pays no extra pass.
 * Kill criterion: the handlers directory holds no SessionState/SessionStore importers
 *   (both sets empty), or a maintainer decision re-scopes where handler authority may live.

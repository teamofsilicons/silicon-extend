// Broken-on-purpose targets that prove the harness can still fail (#1414).
//
// A fuzz lane whose classifier or watchdog regresses goes green forever, which is worse than
// no lane at all. These targets each violate the invariant one way, so `--self-check` (and the
// unit test in harness.test.ts) can assert the harness reports every failure kind. They are
// deliberately kept out of FUZZ_TARGETS: only the registry resolves them by name, so a normal
// run never sees them and no production module gains a test-only seam.

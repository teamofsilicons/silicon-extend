// Expectation gate for the CLI validation generator (#1781 B2).
//
// A validation case asserts a specific outcome the generator planted, so a drifted generator is
// worse than a weak one: it would report phantom findings nightly (or mark real bugs expected).
// This replays fixed-seed samples against the real parser in-process — every planted expectation
// must hold on a healthy tree, every class must still fire, and each class must be refused in the
// parser layer it claims, so the lane's real reach stays disclosed rather than implied.

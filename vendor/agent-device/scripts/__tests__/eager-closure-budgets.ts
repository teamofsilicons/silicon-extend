// Per-entry eager-closure budgets -- the ADR-0019 loading-shape probe (#1739, #1960).
//
// ADR-0019's "Implementation-laziness" section requires platform-package façades to stay
// implementation-lazy and says a startup-time threshold alone does not preserve the loading
// shape (`docs/adr/0019-request-bound-platform-runtime.md`). The AST walker in
// `src/__tests__/eager-import-closure.fixtures.ts` counts the repo modules that importing an
// entry evaluates; this module says what count each entry may have. R13 governs import
// DIRECTION (may this file reach that one at all), never evaluation WEIGHT.
//
// Entries are every package entry surface `facadeEntryFiles` discovers plus the hand-listed hubs
// below. Each falls under one rule, chosen by its category, which is derived from its path:
//
// - `platform-facade` (`packages/platform-<family>/src/index.ts`): EXACT. It evaluates one
//   module, itself -- metadata inline, contract imports type-only, every implementation behind a
//   function-scoped `await import`. A single static value import destroys the property.
// - Every other entry that exists at the merge-base with origin/main: NO GROWTH. Its closure may
//   not be larger than the closure of the same file (renames followed) in the committed
//   merge-base tree, read through `committed-source-tree.ts`. Shrinking needs no edit: there is
//   no number to keep in step, and the next merge-base keeps the gain.
// - An entry absent at the merge-base: a per-category CEILING (`NEW_ENTRY_CEILINGS`). At or
//   under it, nothing to write. Over it, one `APPROVED_OVER_CEILING` row naming the issue, the
//   reason, and an owner; the row records no number, and the merge-base carries the entry from
//   the next PR on. A row is stale once nothing can read it -- the entry is gone, the merge-base
//   now carries it, or its closure fits the ceiling -- and a stale row fails, EXCEPT where the
//   merge-base is the head itself and no row is readable at all (`staleApprovalRows`).
//
// Independent of size, a façade entry's closure must never reach a concrete platform
// implementation (`PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS`) before discovery or binding selects an
// owner -- the ADR-0019 property itself, and the reason the exceptions below are named.

/**
 * When two or more entries grow by the SAME newly-added module, the per-entry diagnostic above
 * cannot show the shape that actually matters: there is no old edge to make lazy, because the
 * module is brand new, so "move it behind a dynamic import" is not even coherent advice. The
 * useful question is "where does this already have a home", and the answer is scoped to what
 * every affected entry already evaluates, under the added module's own package -- a real
 * candidate list instead of "somewhere in the repo".
 *
 * #2423's review: five reviewers each independently proposed a dynamic import for a constant that
 * a module already imported eagerly wherever it was needed; the fix was moving the constant
 * there. Nothing in any one entry's own message could show that shape, because each entry's
 * diagnostic only ever describes that one entry's own closure. This runs once, after every entry
 * has been evaluated, and is silent (`null`) unless at least two entries that actually GREW share
 * an added module and their merge-base intersection is non-empty.
 *
 * One block per added module (#2471 review). Two properties the shape has to keep: an entry whose
 * closure did not grow contributes nothing however many modules are new to it, and a home is only
 * ever printed under the added module whose grown entries all evaluate it -- never unioned across
 * groups and labelled as common to every failing entry.
 *
 * Homes are sorted with modules that have no in-package eager import of their own first -- it is
 * cheap here, since a candidate's forward edges are read straight off the base graph that
 * produced it, no extra tree read required -- because a leaf module is the safer home: adding a
 * symbol to it cannot itself grow anyone else's closure.

/**
 * The per-caller selector-resolution policy matrix (#1630): every native
 * consumer of "resolve a selector against the screen" declares its ambiguity
 * contract here instead of passing `requireUnique`/`disambiguateAmbiguous`
 * literals at the call site. The engine stays policy-neutral; which row a
 * caller consumes IS the caller's documented contract, and changing a row is
 * a reviewable one-line policy change instead of a multi-file literal hunt.
 *
 * Ambiguity kinds:
 * - `disambiguate` — unique match required, but the engine's visible→deepest→
 *   smallest-area tiebreak may pick a winner from an ambiguous set (`get text`).
 * - `fail-closed` — unique match required, ties reject (by design: `is`
 *   predicates and `get attrs` must never guess). A set that is one control
 *   reported through its own accessibility wrapper is not a tie and nothing
 *   guesses when it resolves to the control; the pipeline applies that
 *   structural collapse after this door refuses (#2498).
 * - `first-match` — any match count accepted, first wins (existence reads and
 *   the wait loop, where presence is the question).
 * - `reject-candidates` — multiple matches stay visible to the caller, which
 *   either proves structural equivalence (acting targets) or rejects with a
 *   candidate list (#1625's mutating-find contract). It is not reducible to
 *   engine knobs, so `selectorResolutionKnobs` rejects it at the type level.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow: this matrix declares the **ambiguity contract
 * and the rect requirement**, and nothing else. Both are consumed by
 * `resolveSelectorChainWithPolicy` — the one door native callers have, since
 * the package façade exports no knob-taking resolver — and pinned behaviorally
 * in resolution-policy-parity.test.ts, so a row that stops matching its
 * documented semantics fails a test.
 *
 * The surrounding pipeline stages — occlusion, the off-screen guard,
 * hittable-ancestor promotion, and the wait poll budget — are declared in the
 * companion structural table, `packages/selectors/src/selector-pipeline-policy.ts` (#1656),
 * whose rows each name one row of this matrix. They live there rather than
 * here because this package is deliberately blind to snapshot occlusion
 * annotations, backend visibility probes, and the wait clock: a column here
 * would be a claim nothing in this package could enforce (#1649 review).

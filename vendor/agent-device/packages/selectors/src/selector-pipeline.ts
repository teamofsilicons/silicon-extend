/**
 * The owner of selector resolution (#1656). Every native route reaches the
 * matching engine and the structural stages ONLY through the entries below,
 * which take a policy row and run what it declares — including the stages it
 * declares as skips. The stage functions themselves are private to this
 * module, so a caller cannot run three stages and forget the fourth, and
 * cannot pair one row's candidate set with another row's ambiguity contract:
 * the row enters once, at the top.
 *
 * That containment is what makes a cell falsifiable. A route that composes the
 * stages itself can declare `promotion: 'none'` and be believed without
 * executing anything, which is true of the table and unprovable in production;
 * because every route runs its row here instead of re-deriving it, flipping any
 * cell changes what `get`, `is`, `wait`, `find`, `click`, and `fill` do.
 * `scripts/layering/selector-pipeline-ownership.ts` keeps the raw engine
 * unreachable from anywhere else, so that stays true.
 *
 * Three entries, because the rows genuinely ask two different questions of the
 * engine and one route family never asks it at all:
 * - `resolveSelectorPipeline` — rows that want ONE target (reads, `wait`, the
 *   covered-diagnosis probe).
 * - `listSelectorPipelineMatches` — `reject-candidates` rows, whose contract is
 *   that the caller sees every candidate and narrows or refuses explicitly.
 *   A row whose RESULT is the candidate set (`find <q> list`) declares only the
 *   two stages a listing can run, so the node-stage entries below reject it at
 *   the type level rather than skipping stages it claimed.
 * - `runNodePipelineStages` — the node stages for a target that came from a
 *   non-chain matcher (`@ref` lookup, find's fuzzy locator) or from a narrowed
 *   candidate set. Not a bypass: it runs every stage the row declares.

/**
 * #1621 (recycled runner pid) as a real-process scenario rather than
 * `readProcessStartTime` mock choreography, per #1631's acceptance criteria.
 *
 * A lease file can outlive its runner by days, and the OS recycles pids — so
 * a stale lease's `runnerPid` may now belong to somebody else's process.
 * Here that "somebody else" is a REAL child process we spawn and own: its pid
 * and start time come from the OS, and `readProcessStartTime` runs for real.
 * The lease then claims that pid with a start time that does not match, which
 * is exactly the recycled shape. Cleanup must refuse to signal it.
 *
 * Asserting through the injected cleanup adapter (a production seam, not a
 * test-only one) rather than by observing a kill keeps the test safe: a
 * regression reports a pid here instead of signalling a live process.
 *
 * The lease is written under this process's own owner token, so cleanup
 * classifies it as `owned` without reading the OWNER's start time — the one
 * `ps` read this test needs is the child's, which is its actual subject.
 * Depending on owner-identity reads is what makes such tests flake under
 * full-suite contention (see #1642).
 *
 * Deliberately only the refusal direction. It is contention-PROOF: the
 * recorded start time never matches, so whether the verification read
 * succeeds or times out under load, the verdict is the same refusal. The
 * opposite direction ("identity matches, so signal") cannot be made robust
 * with a real process — it needs a second live `ps` read inside production
 * code, and a timed-out read there flips the result. That direction is
 * covered by the mocked start-time cases in `runner-session.test.ts`, where
 * pinning the read is the point rather than a workaround.

/**
 * Recorded startup failures for {@link classifyRunnerStartupFailure} (#2680).
 *
 * Provenance is the point of this file, so it is stated per entry and never as a blanket claim:
 *
 * - `captured` — `output` was pasted from a run, and `command` plus `xcodeVersion` (from
 *   `xcodebuild -version`) were recorded with it by `.device-evidence/CHECKLIST-runner-failures.md`.
 * - `shipped-sniff-trigger` — the substrings a rule matches are the ones shipped in
 *   `resolveSigningFailureHint` before #2680, which is evidence xcodebuild can emit them. The
 *   sentence around them is ours, so `command` and `xcodeVersion` stay unrecorded.
 * - `invented-shape` — no shipped trigger and no capture. The entry exists to exercise a rule and
 *   makes no claim about wording xcodebuild prints.
 *
 * Until Phase B captures the real runs, every entry is `unobserved` for `xcodeVersion` and carries
 * no `command`: an invocation we did not run is not provenance. Nothing in the classifier reads
 * these fields; they exist so a reason can be traced to an observation instead of to a guess.
 *
 * Blocked on the host, not unexamined. One Phase B run on `thymikee-iphone` / Xcode 26.2 settled the
 * shape question these rows were held on — `No profiles for '<id>' were found` arrives as one long
 * `error:` line, not a wrapped one — and `no-profiles-for-bundle-id` below is now `captured`. The
 * rest are gated on an Apple account this machine does not have, and they need it for the same
 * reason: the build either signs successfully or dies before reaching the diagnostic a row keys on.
 * `requires-development-team` and `requires-development-team-message-only` need an account that is
 * signed in with no development team; automatic signing resolves the team from any installed
 * identity, so unsetting `AGENT_DEVICE_IOS_TEAM_ID` builds successfully.
 * `bundle-id-registration-failed`, `app-id-not-available` and the `bundle_identifier_unavailable`
 * rule it feeds, plus `profile-does-not-cover-app-id` (`Provisioning profile` + `doesn't include`)
 * and `profile-expired` (`Provisioning profile` + `has expired`), all need a profile and an app id
 * already claimed by someone else: against a working account `-allowProvisioningUpdates` registers
 * or repairs the id, so the conflict text is never printed and the build reaches signing success.
 * Each of those rows is therefore uninducible here rather than untested, and none of them should be
 * read as waiting on effort this machine can supply.

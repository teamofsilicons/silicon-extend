 *
 * - `starting`: registered and launched, no runner response read yet. A command sent now queues
 *   behind the connection probe, so the session cannot be used.
 * - `ready`: the runner answered a command, so its HTTP channel works. The process can still die

 * - `draining`: disposal began. The lease is still held and the process is still being signalled,
 *   so the runner can still answer, but the session must not be chosen for new work.
 * - `stopped`: this session's disposable resources settled, or its ownership was handed to

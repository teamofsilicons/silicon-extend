 * the focused app token answers "which app is foreground" and can never answer "is a dialog

 * normally answers still prints nothing during a window transition, and one such sample must not
 * demote it — only a variant this device has never once answered from is demoted, which is the
 * structural property (the OS build's dump layout) the ordering is trying to exploit.
 *
 * It is a demotion, never a removal, and never across a tier: a demoted variant moves to the back
 * of its own tier and is still asked when nothing ahead of it answers, so a wrong record costs
 * ordering, never an answer.

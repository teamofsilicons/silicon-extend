/**
 * Machine-readable wait failure taxonomy. These values are carried in

 * wait error messages.
 *
 * `wait_capture_stalled` means no readable capture established an observation
 * before the deadline and is retriable. `wait_deadline_exceeded` means a later
 * capture consumed the remaining budget after at least one readable capture.
 * `wait_readiness_exhausted` means the deadline cancelled a poll that was still
 * making the target observable; `details.readinessPhase` names the work, and
 * `wait_runner_restart_exhausted` is the same verdict for a runner restart.
 * `wait_target_absent` is the ordinary timeout reason for a selector that was
 * never found. `wait_target_present` is the strict-absence timeout reason when
 * valid captures still contain matches. The remaining reasons describe
 * stability and replay-landmark refusals.

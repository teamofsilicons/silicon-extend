/**
 * Closed result of the `keyboard` command, grounded in the runtime operation
 * results projected by `src/daemon/keyboard-runtime.ts`.
 *
 * `platform` and `action` are always present; the remaining fields appear per
 * branch (Android `status`/`dismiss` carry the keyboard-state fields; `enter`
 * and iOS `dismiss` carry a `message`). It is kept as a flat closed shape rather
 * than a five-way `platform`×`action` union because the per-branch field sets
 * overlap heavily and the underlying Android keyboard-state types live in the
 * platform layer (below the public contract). The `Record` index signature of
 * the previous hand-written mirror is dropped, and the spurious `| null`s are
 * removed (the handler never returns `null` for these).

// Shared vocabulary, not a replay internal — the daemon writes it (8 modules), `replay/` parses and

// `packages/ad-replay/src/internal/target-identity.ts`
// alongside the parsing logic, which meant `SessionAction` could not be stated without depending on
// the replay zone. The parsing and classification logic now lives in `@agent-device/ad-script`;
// only the shape moved.

 * The times to sample from a clip of `durationMs`, spread evenly across the whole timeline.
 *
 * Coverage is the point: the grid always names the start and the end, and it never grows with the
 * recording. A 5s take samples 21 times; a 2h take samples the same 48 times across its length, so
 * a long recording costs the same decode budget as a short one and still shows both endpoints.
 *
 * A grid is a promise with a hole in it. A flash that opens and closes entirely between two sample
 * times is not in the returned frames and no threshold can recover it; that is why the sheet
 * reports how many times it sampled rather than claiming to have reviewed the footage.
 *
 * A clip whose timeline cannot be read is refused rather than guessed at. Sampling an unknown
 * length would mean either walking the whole file or drawing a grid over a duration the container
 * never claimed, and a sheet built that way could not say what it covered.

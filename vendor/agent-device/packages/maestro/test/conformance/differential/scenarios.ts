//
// A small set of flows run through BOTH real Maestro and agent-device on a live
// device. Opt-in/dispatch — never part of per-PR unit CI.
//
// These flows live in ./flows and target the real fixture app
// (examples/test-app, `com.callstack.agentdevicelab`), which the workflow builds
// and installs. They are deliberately NOT the layer-1 corpus: those flows exist
// only to be PARSED — they name a fictional `com.example.app` and elements that
// exist nowhere — so pointing a device run at them would fail before exercising
// any runtime behavior.
//
// Read the field names literally. Cross-engine comparison is OUTCOME parity (does
// the flow pass on both engines), which only catches a divergence severe enough
// to fail the flow. Anything finer — settle latching, retap counts, truncated
// pixel coordinates — is not visible to outcome parity, so where we can assert it
// we do it engine-side via `engineInvariants` over agent-device's own replay
// timing trace. Scenarios without invariants prove outcome parity ONLY; do not
// read more into them than that.

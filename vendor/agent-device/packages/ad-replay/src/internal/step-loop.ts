/**
 * #1478 P5 stage C2b: the `.ad` step-loop ENGINE policy, split out of
 * `src/daemon/replay/internal/native-command.ts`'s replay orchestration /
 * `resolveReplayStepResponse` / `buildReplayActionFailure`. Everything that
 * touches a real device, a snapshot, `SessionStore`, or the P4b repair
 * coordinator is daemon authority and stays behind the narrow
 * `AdReplayStepRuntime` capabilities (`./runtime-port-types.ts`) — this
 * module only decides which action to run next, when to skip one, and when
 * to stop.
 *
 * #1555 structural-quality review ("split step-loop.ts per the maestro
 * precedent it cites"): this file used to also hold the full boundary
 * vocabulary and the verify-then-dispatch orchestrator — both extracted out,
 * following `packages/maestro`'s own three-way split
 * (`runtime-port-types.ts` for the vocabulary, its engine files for the
 * orchestration logic). `./runtime-port-types.ts` now owns every
 * `AdReplayStepRuntime`-adjacent type; `./verify-dispatch.ts` owns
 * `verifyAndDispatchStep` and its two dispatch helpers. This file is left
 * with exactly the loop (`runAdReplay`) and the terminal-close/executable-
 * action structural logic it drives.
 *
 * #1554 fold-in (rebase onto main's `replay --keep-session`): main grew a
 * terminal-close-suppression decision independently, daemon-side, as
 * `runAdReplay`'s `resolveSuppressedTerminalCloseIndex`
 * / `countExecutedReplayActions`, generalizing the repair-only physical-last-
 * index check this module already had (`isRepairArmedTerminalCloseAction`) to
 * "terminal among EXECUTABLE actions" and adding `--keep-session` as a second
 * reason to suppress. Per the same "pure policy belongs in the engine"
 * boundary this whole module exists to enforce, that generalized resolution
 * — `resolveSuppressedTerminalCloseIndex` below — lives here instead,
 * unified with (replacing) the old repair-only predicate, and `runAdReplay`
 * folds the resulting `replayed` count in directly rather than a separate
 * daemon-side post-hoc counter. `requireLiveSessionForKeepSession` — the
 * `--keep-session` postcondition that inspects `SessionStore` — stays daemon
 * authority and never moved here.
 *
 * #1555 review P1 (second pass, "move variable semantics/planning behind the
 * replay entrypoint"): `runAdReplay` builds the `${VAR}` scope, via
 * `@agent-device/ad-script`'s `buildReplayVarScope`, from the request's
 * `varSources` — plain data (builtins/file/shell/cli env) the daemon reads
 * from the request/process — and resolves each action EXACTLY ONCE per step
 * (`resolveReplayAction`), before `verifyAndDispatchStep` does anything else
 * with it. The RESOLVED action is what reaches `dispatchStep` and
 * `beginTargetVerification`; every other capability still receives the
 * ORIGINAL recorded `action` (a target-binding divergence reports the
 * recorded selector, never an expanded `${VAR}`). This replaces two
 * independent daemon-side interpolation call sites — dispatch's own
 * (`session-replay-action-runtime.ts`'s `invokeReplayAction`) and target
 * verification's separate one (`session-replay-target-verification.ts`'s
 * `resolveTargetVerificationEntry`) — with this one engine-owned resolution.
 * The engine's own live scope is also the one source for the `${VAR}` values
 * a divergence report may redact (`collectReplayScrubbableVarValues`),
 * computed ONCE per run and threaded to each build-failure/`handleActionFailure`
 * capability as an explicit `scrubVars` argument rather than recomputed per
 * call site — the daemon never holds a `ReplayVarScope` value at all.
 *
 * #1478 P5 follow-up (one daemon-owned artifact ledger): artifact-path
 * accumulation used to be DOUBLE-WRITTEN — `dispatchStep` added each step's
 * entries to the daemon's own `Set` (`runReplayCommand`'s, read by its
 * catch block so a mid-loop throw still reports what was collected) AND
 * returned them for this loop to add to a second `Set` of its own. Two
 * mutable collections, kept in sync by hand, with no single owner. The
 * daemon's `Set` is now the run's ONE ledger: `dispatchStep` writes it and
 * returns its contents, and `artifactPaths` below is just the latest such
 * return value — re-bound, never mutated. `AdReplayRunOutcome.artifactPaths`
 * stays a façade field (it is wire-relevant: the daemon's success response
 * reports it), but it is now a projection of what the capability handed back
 * rather than an independently accumulated set.
 *
 * The ledger deliberately does NOT carry a divergence build's own artifacts
 * (`buildTargetBindingFailure` and friends produce a fresh capture): those
 * reach `handleActionFailure` through `mergeArtifactPaths` as a derived
 * value. Writing them into the ledger instead would change what the daemon's
 * catch block reports when `handleActionFailure` itself throws — the one
 * observable difference between the two old sets, preserved exactly.
 */

/**
 * ADR 0012 step 4's step loop: for every executable action from
 * `request.entryIndex` on, arm the save-script transaction, skip a
 * repair-armed or `--keep-session` plan's terminal `close` (lifecycle, not a
 * script step), report progress, verify-then-dispatch through
 * `verifyAndDispatchStep`, and stop at the first failure. Moved verbatim from
 * `executeReplayActions`'s composition order — only the daemon capabilities
 * it calls through were narrowed into `runtime`.
 *
 * #1554 fold-in: `terminalCloseIndex` is resolved ONCE, structurally, from
 * `actions` alone (independent of which mode wants it suppressed) via
 * `resolveSuppressedTerminalCloseIndex`. Whether it actually gets suppressed
 * THIS run is decided per-step, at the point the loop reaches it: `keepSession`
 * is a static per-run flag, but repair-armed is checked through
 * `runtime.isRepairArmed()` right after `runtime.armStep()` — deliberately
 * dynamic, because a bare `--save-script` first arms the transaction on this
 * very call (`armStep()` mutates the session), so re-reading it here (rather
 * than snapshotting it before the loop) is what lets a first-arm run and a
 * continuing `--from` leg share one check. The suppressed index is excluded
 * from `replayed` exactly like a skipped `replay` pseudo-action — never
 * dispatched, never divergence-checked, never counted.
 *
 * `scrubVars` (the `${VAR}` values a divergence report may redact) is
 * computed ONCE PER STEP — right after `resolveReplayAction` (the one call
 * that can grow the scope's expanded-builtins set THIS step) — and threaded
 * down to `verifyAndDispatchStep`/`handleActionFailure` as an explicit
 * argument, never recomputed per call inside the verify/dispatch chain
 * (`collectReplayScrubbableVarValues` is otherwise pure over `scope`, so
 * every one of those call sites would recompute the identical value).

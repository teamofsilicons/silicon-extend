/**
 * The daemon code signature for a SOURCE checkout, where the import graph is
 * ~1,500 separate modules rather than a bundle — the daemon's own tree plus
 * every workspace package it reaches by specifier. The client fingerprints
 * that graph on every CLI invocation (`isReusableDaemonInfo`), and
 * rediscovering its edges means reading all of them: tens of milliseconds of a
 * ~245ms invocation, for a graph that is identical on every invocation but the
 * first one after an edit.
 *
 * So the walk is cached and revalidated by `statSync` alone, which is exactly
 * as strong as the walk it replaces because a document records the walk's
 * whole input, not just its output. Every recorded file still matching its
 * `size:mtime` means an unchanged file — that pair is what the signature
 * already treats as the stand-in for contents (`DaemonCodeFileStamp`) —
 * therefore an unchanged specifier list; and every path in `absent` still
 * being absent means each of those specifiers still resolves where it did
 * (`DaemonCodeGraphWalk`). Unchanged specifiers resolving unchanged is an
 * unchanged graph, so re-walking could only rediscover the recorded stamps.
 *
 * Any mismatched, vanished, or newly non-file entry, any path recorded as
 * absent that now exists, and any unreadable, malformed, foreign, or
 * entry-less cache document, falls back to the full walk, which republishes.
 * The cache is a best-effort artifact under `os.tmpdir()`, like the Swift
 * toolchain cache: failing to read or write one only costs the walk.

title: Replay & E2E Testing

# Replay & E2E Testing

Agents use refs for exploration and authoring. Replay scripts are deterministic runs that can be used for E2E testing.

## Core model

Two-pass workflow:

1. Agent pass: discover and interact with refs (`snapshot` -> `click @e..` / `fill @e..`).
2. Deterministic pass: run recorded `.ad` script with `replay`.

## Record a replay script

Enable recording during a session:

```bash
agent-device open Settings --platform ios --session e2e --save-script
agent-device snapshot -i --session e2e
agent-device click @e13 --session e2e
agent-device close --session e2e
```

By default, on `close`, a replay script is written to:

```text
~/.agent-device/sessions/<session>-<timestamp>.ad
```

You can also provide a custom output file path:

```bash
agent-device open Settings --platform ios --session e2e --save-script ./workflows/e2e-settings.ad
```

- `--save-script` value is treated as a file path.
- Parent directories are created automatically when they do not exist.
- For ambiguous bare values, use `--save-script=workflow.ad` or a path-like value such as `./workflow.ad`.

## Run replay

```bash
agent-device replay ~/.agent-device/sessions/e2e-2026-02-09T12-00-00-000Z.ad --session e2e-run
```

- Replay reads `.ad` scripts.
- A script without a terminal `close` already leaves its session active. For an existing script that
  does end in `close`, pass `--keep-session` to suppress only that final action and continue with
  interactive commands in the same session:

  ```bash
  agent-device replay ./checkout.ad --session e2e-run --keep-session
  agent-device snapshot -i --session e2e-run
  ```

  Interior `close` actions still run. The flag is intentionally unavailable to `test` because suite
  attempts own cleanup, and it is rejected for Maestro YAML because that runtime owns its lifecycle.

## Run Maestro compatibility flows

Agent Device can run a supported subset of Maestro YAML through its typed Maestro compatibility runtime:

```bash
agent-device replay ./flow.yaml --maestro --platform ios --session e2e-run
agent-device test ./maestro-flows --maestro --platform android --artifacts-dir ./tmp/maestro-artifacts
```

Supported subset:

- Flows: `launchApp` (with `clearState`, `permissions`, and Apple-only launch arguments; `permissions` apply after state clearing but before launch, and a `launchApp` without `permissions` touches nothing — there is no silent `all: allow` default); `setPermissions` (mid-flow permission grants, denials, and resets; `all` resolves in the backend — one simctl call on iOS, the declared permissions on Android — with specific entries overriding after it); `runFlow` file/inline with platform, visibility, and limited boolean conditions; `onFlowStart`/`onFlowComplete`; `repeat.times` and retry.
- Interactions: `tapOn`, `doubleTapOn`, `longPressOn`, `inputText` on the focused element, `eraseText`, `openLink`, `hideKeyboard`, basic `pressKey`, and `back`; selector targets poll until available and support recursive `index`, `childOf`, `above`, `below`, `leftOf`, `rightOf`, `containsChild`, `containsDescendants`, points, and `optional`; outer command labels are metadata, not target selectors.
- Assertions and navigation: `assertVisible`, `assertNotVisible`, `assertTrue` (literal values and `${VAR}` lookups only; `""`, `"false"`, `"0"`, `"null"`, and `"undefined"` are falsy, everything else is truthy), `extendedWaitUntil`, `scroll`, `scrollUntilVisible`, absolute/percentage/target `swipe`, `takeScreenshot`, `waitForAnimationToEnd`, `clearState`, and `stopApp`.
- Scripts: ordered `runScript` file/env scripts with `http.post`, `json`, and `output` variables; `evalScript` inline expressions run flow-scoped JavaScript and write `output.*` leaves for later steps.

Boundaries:

- Permissions: every entry is one `settings permission` call, applied in order with `all` first; the step stops at the first entry the selected platform refuses, earlier entries stay applied, and the error names what landed. Android’s only allow level is while-in-use, so `location: inuse` and `location: never` mean `allow` and `deny` there, while `location: always` and `photos: limited` are Apple-only and fail. On iOS, which service a runtime changes is `simctl privacy`’s own verdict: current runtimes refuse a targeted `notifications` change and leave notifications untouched under `all`.
- Runtime: iOS and Android only; `launchApp.clearState` and standalone `clearState` support Android and iOS simulators, launch arguments are Apple-only, and other standalone device utility/state commands are unsupported.
- Expressions: `evalScript` is the only command whose payload is evaluated as JavaScript (flow `env` and prior `output` leaves are string-typed); with that exception, fields stay literal or `${VAR}` lookup-only — `assertTrue` supports literals and bare lookups, `repeat.while` is unsupported, and other expression-shaped payloads fail loud.
- Environment: flow `env` is the default, `AD_VAR_*` overrides it, and CLI `-e KEY=VALUE` wins over both.
- Failure diagnostics: resolved targets and `runFlow` paths are rendered, while `inputText` payloads remain hidden; do not place secrets in diagnostic identifiers.
- Trust: `runScript` and `evalScript` execute flow scripts in-process via `node:vm`, which is not a security sandbox; `runScript` may make `http.post` network requests and its output keys cannot contain a dot. `evalScript` is refused outright for a flow accepted over the daemon’s remote HTTP surface, since that context can escape to the host.
- Errors and tracking: unsupported commands and fields fail with source context when available; open a focused issue only when implementation work is planned.
- Session takeover: `--keep-session` is a native `.ad` replay option and is rejected for Maestro YAML.

See [ADR 0015](https://github.com/callstack/agent-device/blob/main/docs/adr/0015-direct-maestro-engine.md) for architecture, performance tradeoffs, and deliberate deviations. If a missing feature matters for your suite, [open a focused issue](https://github.com/callstack/agent-device/issues/new) with a small flow snippet.

## Export `.ad` scripts to Maestro YAML

Replay scripts can be exported to a Maestro YAML subset when you need to hand a recorded Agent Device flow to a Maestro runner:

```bash
agent-device replay export ./workflows/checkout.ad --out ./maestro/checkout.yaml
```

`replay export` is a local file transform. It does not start the daemon or contact a device. If `--out` is omitted, the YAML is printed to stdout.

Each `open <appId>` exports with an explicit `launchApp.appId`, so a flow can switch between apps and return to the original app. The first app remains the flow's default `appId`; relaunch options and app-specific deep links stay attached to their authored targets.

Deep links, including schemes without `//` such as `tel:` and `mailto:`, export as `openLink`. A standalone `open tel:+15551234567` emits only the link command; `open com.example.app mailto:agent@example.test` emits the app launch followed by the link.

The exporter is intentionally strict. It writes Maestro YAML for compatible flow actions such as app launch, taps, long press, text input, keyboard dismiss/enter, back, home, text visibility assertions, coordinate swipes, basic scroll, screenshots, and `.ad` `env` directives. `home` exports as `pressKey: Home`, so flows that visit the home screen and reopen the app can be exported. Agent-only inspection or maintenance actions such as `snapshot`, `get`, `record`, `trace`, `settings`, and unsupported selector shapes fail with the source line and action instead of being silently dropped. Known semantic differences are reported as warnings; for example, `.ad` `fill` exports as `tapOn` plus `inputText`, which may append text in Maestro rather than replacing existing field contents. Native `.ad` `label=` selectors export as Maestro `text:` selectors and warn because Maestro text matching is broader than label-only matching.

## Run a lightweight `.ad` suite

```bash
agent-device test ./workflows
agent-device test "./workflows/**/*.ad" --platform android
agent-device test ./workflows --timeout 60000 --retries 1
agent-device test ./workflows --artifacts-dir ./tmp/agent-device-artifacts
agent-device test ./workflows --reporter default --reporter junit:./tmp/junit.xml
```

- `test` discovers `.ad` files from files, directories, or globs and runs them serially.
- Quote relative globs to expand them on the caller from its working directory, including when the directory name contains glob characters such as `[` or `{`. A missing file input without glob characters reports an error.
- `context platform=...` inside each `.ad` file is the target source of truth for suite execution.
- `--platform` is a filter for suite discovery; files without platform metadata are skipped when a filter is present.
- `context timeout=...` and `context retries=...` can be declared per script; CLI flags override metadata. Retries are capped at `3`, and duplicate keys in the context header fail fast instead of silently overriding each other.
- By default, suite artifacts are written under `.agent-device/test-artifacts/<run-id>/...`. Each attempt writes `replay.ad`, `result.txt`, and `replay-timing.ndjson`. Failed attempts also keep copied logs and artifact files when the replay produced them.
- Copied diagnostic artifacts receive numbered filenames when their names collide with another artifact, a replay source, timing trace, or attempt manifest. `result.txt` lists the retained names in `copiedArtifacts`.
- `replay-timing.ndjson` records attempt, cleanup, and per-step start/stop events with durations. Upload it from CI even for passing runs when comparing local and CI performance.
- Timeouts are cooperative: the runner marks the attempt failed at the timeout boundary, then gives the underlying replay a short grace period to stop before session cleanup.
- The default text reporter streams live progress on stderr while a suite runs, then prints the final summary, failed tests, and passed-on-retry flaky tests. Use `--verbose` to include step traces in completed-test progress output.
- The default reporter prints a `Warnings:` section after the summary when any test accumulated composable warnings — for example a Maestro step with `optional: true` that was skipped — whether that test passed or failed. A failing `replay` run repeats the warnings it accumulated as `Warning:` lines after the error. `--json` carries the same strings in each test result's `warnings` array.
- `--reporter` is repeatable. Built-ins are `default` for the console summary and `junit:<path>` for JUnit XML. Passing any explicit reporter list replaces the implicit default reporter, so include `--reporter default` when you also want terminal output. `--report-junit <path>` remains a compatibility alias for `--reporter junit:<path>`.
- JUnit reports preserve legal Unicode and whitespace, and replace characters forbidden by XML 1.0 (such as terminal ESC or NUL) with `U+FFFD` (`�`) so CI parsers can read the report. JSON and other reporters retain the original suite values.
- When `--fail-fast` and retries are both set, the current test still consumes its retries before the suite stops.

### Custom test reporters

Custom reporters are CLI-only presentation adapters. The daemon streams progress and returns the structured replay suite result; reporters run in the local CLI process and can render both live progress and final output.

```bash
agent-device test ./workflows --reporter ./scripts/replay-reporter.mjs
```

Reporter modules can export a reporter object, `reporter`, `createReporter`, or a default factory. Factories receive load context. Reporter hooks receive replay test domain objects and an IO context with `stdout` and `stderr` streams:

```js
// scripts/replay-reporter.mjs
import fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';

export default function createReporter(loadContext) {
  return {
    name: 'summary-file',
    onTestStep(test, context) {
      context.stderr.write(`running ${test.file} ${test.stepIndex}/${test.stepTotal}\n`);
    },
    onSuiteEnd(suite, context) {
      context.stdout.write(`finished ${suite.total} tests\n`);
      fs.mkdirSync('./tmp', { recursive: true });
      fs.writeFileSync(
        path.join('./tmp', 'report.txt'),
        JSON.stringify(
          {
            total: suite.total,
            passed: suite.passed,
            failed: suite.failed,
            modulePath: loadContext.modulePath,
          },
          null,
          2,
        ),
        'utf8',
      );
    },
    getExitCode(suite) {
      return suite.failed > 0 ? 1 : 0;
    },
  };
}
```

For a live terminal reporter that prints each completed test as an emoji, title, and duration:

```js
// scripts/emoji-reporter.mjs
export default {
  name: 'emoji-status',
  onTestResult(test, context) {
    const icon = test.status === 'pass' ? '✓' : test.status === 'fail' ? '⨯' : '-';
    const title = test.title?.trim() || test.file;
    const duration =
      typeof test.durationMs === 'number' ? ` ${(test.durationMs / 1000).toFixed(2)}s` : '';

    context.stderr.write(`${icon} ${title}${duration}\n`);
  },
};
```

TypeScript reporters use the same object shape; compile them to JavaScript before passing them to `--reporter`:

```ts
const createReporter = () => ({
  name: 'typed-reporter',
  onSuiteStart(suite, context) {
    context.stderr.write(`starting ${suite.runnable} tests\n`);
  },
  onTestResult(test, context) {
    context.stderr.write(`${test.status} ${test.title ?? test.file}\n`);
  },
  onSuiteEnd(suite) {
    // Write artifacts, annotations, or summaries from suite.
  },
});

export default createReporter;
```

The CLI loads reporter modules with Node dynamic `import()`. Use `.mjs` or `.js` files at runtime; for TypeScript, compile the reporter to JavaScript before passing it to `--reporter`. Loading `.ts` files directly depends on Node's type-stripping behavior and is not part of the supported reporter contract.

Live reporter hooks are semantic: `onSuiteStart`, `onTestStart`, `onTestStep`, and `onTestResult` run while the daemon request is active; generic command progress frames are not exposed to test reporters. These live hooks are synchronous — they run from the progress stream as events arrive and are not awaited, so keep their work synchronous and defer anything async to `onSuiteEnd`, which the CLI awaits before exiting. `onSuiteEnd` receives the final suite result. `getExitCode` can only raise the suite exit code, never lower it: the highest reporter-provided code wins and failed tests still exit with `1` when no reporter raises it further, so a reporter cannot mask a failing suite. Return an integer from `0` to `255`, or `undefined` to leave the exit code unchanged. Other values fail with `INVALID_ARGS`; in particular, codes such as `256` are rejected before they can wrap to a successful process exit.

## Parametrise `.ad` scripts

Substitute `${VAR}` tokens in `.ad` scripts using values from the CLI, shell env, script-local `env` directives, or built-ins.

```sh
context platform=android
env APP_ID=settings
env WAIT_SHORT=500

open ${APP_ID} --relaunch
wait ${WAIT_SHORT}
click "label=${APP_ID}"
```

### Precedence

| Source                       | Priority | Example                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI `-e KEY=VALUE`           | highest  | `agent-device test flow.ad -e APP_ID=demo`                              |
| Shell env prefixed `AD_VAR_` |          | `AD_VAR_APP_ID=demo agent-device test flow.ad` (imported as `APP_ID`)   |
| Script `env KEY=VALUE`       |          | `env APP_ID=settings` in header                                         |
| Built-ins                    | runtime  | `AD_PLATFORM`, `AD_SESSION`, `AD_FILENAME`, `AD_DEVICE`, `AD_ARTIFACTS` |

### Built-ins

Built-ins are provided by replay/test runtime and use the reserved `AD_*` namespace.

- `AD_PLATFORM` - matches `context platform=...` or the selected platform when available
- `AD_SESSION` - active session name
- `AD_FILENAME` - path of the running `.ad` file
- `AD_DEVICE` - device identifier (when `--device` is set)
- `AD_ARTIFACTS` - attempt artifacts directory (when running under `test`)

User-defined keys starting with `AD_` are rejected in `env`, `-e`, and shell imports such as `AD_VAR_AD_FOO`, so built-ins cannot be overridden.

Substitution happens inside parsed string values. It does not create extra arguments, so quote selectors or text values that contain spaces:

```sh
env SETTINGS="label=Account || label=Profile"
click "${SETTINGS}"
```

### Fallback and escape

```sh
wait ${WAIT_MS:-500}
```

`${VAR:-default}` yields `default` when `VAR` is unset.

```sh
echo "Price: \${APP}"
```

`\${APP}` emits a literal `${APP}` with no substitution.

### Recipes

Run one flow against two app variants in CI:

```sh
agent-device test ./flows/login.ad -e APP_ID=com.example.debug
agent-device test ./flows/login.ad -e APP_ID=com.example.release
```

Tune timings locally without editing the script:

```sh
AD_VAR_WAIT_SHORT=2000 agent-device replay ./flow.ad
```

Extract a reusable selector. Before:

```sh
click "label=Account || label=Profile || label=User"
wait 500
click "label=Account || label=Profile || label=User"
```

After:

```sh
env SETTINGS="label=Account || label=Profile || label=User"

click "${SETTINGS}"
wait 500
click "${SETTINGS}"
```

Quote `${VAR}` inside selector expressions so the whole expression is treated as a single argument.

### Notes

- Shell env (`AD_VAR_*`) is collected on the CLI/client side at request time, so the same values are seen whether the daemon runs locally or remotely.
- No nested fallback. `${A:-${B}}` is not supported.
- Unresolved `${VAR}` fails with a `file:line` reference. Typos are loud.

## Replay divergence and resume

A failing `replay`/`test` step returns a structured `REPLAY_DIVERGENCE` error instead of a bare failure. The report carries, bounded and redacted:

- **`step`** — the 1-based plan index and its source file/line (through Maestro `runFlow` includes).
- **`screen`** — a fresh post-failure snapshot digest with actionable refs, or `unavailable` with a reason/hint when capture failed or was sparse (never a stale tree).
- **`suggestions`** — up to 5 ranked, re-resolved candidates for the failing selector (id match ranks above role+label, which ranks above label-only), each with a `basis` you can inspect before acting.
- **`resume`** — whether and how to continue without re-running the script from the top.

```jsonc
{
  "code": "REPLAY_DIVERGENCE",
  "details": {
    "divergence": {
      "step": { "index": 4, "source": { "path": "flow.ad", "line": 6 } },
      "screen": {
        "state": "available",
        "refsGeneration": 3,
        "refs": [
          /* ... */
        ],
      },
      "suggestions": [{ "selector": "id=\"auth_continue\"", "basis": "id" }],
      "resume": { "allowed": true, "from": 4, "planDigest": "…64 hex chars…" },
    },
  },
}
```

Text output prints a compact summary of the same fields; `--json`/MCP carry the full object.

### Resuming a failed replay

`replay --from <n> --plan-digest <sha256>` resumes **at** plan step `n`, not after it, skipping `1..n-1` without executing them. Both flags come from a divergence report's `resume` field — `from` is the failed step, `planDigest` is the digest of the exact unchanged plan that produced it.

Choose one recovery workflow:

1. **Change the replay script.** Review the suggestion, edit the selector or include, then run a fresh full `replay ./flow.ad`. The old digest is intentionally invalid after any plan edit; do not combine it with the edited script. A later divergence supplies a new digest.
2. **Keep the replay plan unchanged.** Repair app/device state so the reported failed step can succeed when retried, then resume with the report's unchanged `from` and `planDigest`. If you manually complete the failed action itself, the reported `from` will execute it again; only do that when repeating the action is safe.

The unchanged-plan resume loop is:

1. Run `replay ./flow.ad`. On failure, read `resume` from the divergence.
2. Leave the script, includes, platform, and target unchanged. Repair app state yourself so the failed step can be retried safely. The daemon never infers or reconstructs app state — it only skips execution of the earlier steps.
3. `replay ./flow.ad --from <resume.from> --plan-digest <resume.planDigest>`.

```bash
agent-device replay ./flow.ad
# ... REPLAY_DIVERGENCE, resume: { allowed: true, from: 4, planDigest: "ab12...“ }
# (repair app state on the device)
agent-device replay ./flow.ad --from 4 --plan-digest ab12...
```

For Maestro flows, `--from` addresses the immutable top-level typed plan. Compact runtime control nodes
remain single plan steps and nested commands are not independently addressable. As with generic `.ad`
replay, the caller is responsible for restoring any state and environment values established by skipped
steps before resuming.

Passing `--plan-digest` that no longer matches the current script — because you edited it, an include changed, or platform-conditioned expansion differs — fails `INVALID_ARGS` before any action; run a fresh full replay to get a new digest. `--from` is `replay`-only; `test` rejects it (a suite run must stay full and deterministic).

## `--update`/`-u` (retired)

`--update`/`-u` no longer rewrites `.ad` files. Historically it retried a failing step against the recorded selector's candidate material and rewrote the line in place; the audit behind [ADR 0012](https://github.com/callstack/agent-device/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-interactive-replay.md) found that mechanism rarely able to act (it can only recover drift the original selector still matches, never a rename) and a silent rewrite is a target-binding risk on its own. The flag is kept, accepted, and is a complete no-op: every replay divergence already carries the same ranked `suggestions` the old heal path used to apply blind, whether or not `--update` is passed. Review a suggestion, then edit the `.ad` file yourself if it's right.

## Troubleshooting

- Replay fails after UI/layout changes:
  - Read the divergence report's `suggestions` and repair the selector by hand; there is no automated rewrite. Because the edit changes the plan digest, run a fresh full replay instead of using the old resume flags.
- Repeated re-runs are slow or the app is stateful, but the script is still correct:
  - Leave the replay plan unchanged, repair app state so the reported failed step can be retried, then use its `--from`/`--plan-digest`. Resume starts at `--from`; it does not skip that step.
- Replay file parse error:
  - Validate quoting in `.ad` lines (unclosed quotes are rejected).
- Maestro compatibility flow fails on unsupported syntax:
  - Check [ADR 0015](https://github.com/callstack/agent-device/blob/main/docs/adr/0015-direct-maestro-engine.md). If the missing feature matters to your suite, open a focused issue with a small flow snippet.

# Security & Trust

`agent-device` runs locally by default and controls the devices, simulators, emulators, and desktop apps available to the current user. Treat it like any other developer tool that can interact with apps, capture screens, and read diagnostic output.

## Local control

- Device automation runs through the installed CLI and platform tooling such as Xcode, ADB, Amazon Vega CLI/VDA, macOS accessibility APIs, and Linux AT-SPI.
- The MCP server exposes direct structured tools for `agent-device` commands. Tools use command contracts through `AgentDeviceClient`; local-only workflows stay CLI-only rather than subprocess fallbacks. It does not expose generic shell execution over MCP.
- Mutating commands should run serially against one session. Use separate sessions/devices for parallel work.

## Daemon trust model

CLI commands run through a per-user background daemon:

- The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` only, on ephemeral ports, for both its socket and HTTP transports. It is never reachable from the network unless you deliberately front it with your own proxy.
- Command (RPC), upload, artifact-download, and `/admin/human-control/*` requests must present a token generated fresh on each daemon boot (24 random bytes). The only unauthenticated endpoint is `GET /health`, which intentionally returns a bare liveness response and nothing else; like the rest of the server it is reachable only via loopback. The token is stored in `daemon.json` inside the daemon state directory (`~/.agent-device` for packaged installs; source checkouts use a worktree-scoped directory under `~/.agent-device/dev/`) with `0600` permissions; whoever can read that file already has your user account.
- A client reuses a running daemon only when the version matches its own and both sides can vouch for the same code, which the daemon records in `daemon.json` as its code origin. Two installs of one published version are the same artifact, so they have nothing further to compare and share one daemon; demanding a fingerprint between them made the second install replace a daemon already running its code and drop the live session on it (#2458). Every other pair is judged by the daemon's code fingerprint: a checkout compares its own, and a pair whose trees cannot match at all — a checkout against an install, or an install against a daemon too old to report an origin — restarts the daemon rather than run code it cannot identify. The fingerprint compares file sizes and timestamps, never contents, so an install whose files were hand-replaced under its own version is still not detected.
- Artifact uploads are size-capped, filenames are sanitized, and archive extraction rejects path-traversal entries. Artifact downloads resolve through server-side IDs, never client-supplied paths.

For remote or cloud deployments, the daemon supports a custom auth hook for remotely consumable HTTP routes: `AGENT_DEVICE_HTTP_AUTH_HOOK` names a module path that is dynamically imported (with `AGENT_DEVICE_HTTP_AUTH_EXPORT` selecting the export). The host-local `/admin/human-control/*` route uses the daemon token instead. The hook runs with the daemon's full privileges, so treat it as part of your trusted computing base: point it only at a read-only path you control, never at a location writable by less-trusted users or processes. Whoever controls the daemon's environment controls the hook.

Lease-owner human-control RPCs pass normal authentication and tenant/lease admission. They can
target only the admitted lease's device and cannot alter a host administrator's hold. Host
administration is a separate capability: the daemon accepts `/admin/human-control/*` only on its
loopback listener with the local daemon token, and `agent-device proxy` does not forward `/admin/*`.
Holds and leases are in-memory; neither survives daemon restart.

If a hook is configured and its result does not attest a `tenantId`, the daemon refuses the request (401) outright — it never falls back to a tenant the client declares itself (RPC body `meta.tenantId` or `flags.tenant`, or the `x-agent-device-tenant` header on the upload/artifact-download/diagnostics routes), and it never admits the request unscoped either: a shared token must not let one caller claim another tenant's identity, nor read a tenant-owned session or artifact by simply declaring none. A hook must attest `tenantId` on every request it wants admitted; a deployment with no hook configured is unaffected.

## Sensitive artifacts

Screenshots, recordings, traces, logs, network dumps, audio probes, replay files, provider-hosted cloud videos/logs, and reports can contain private UI state, credentials, tokens, request data, timing signals, or customer information. Store them in a controlled directory, review before sharing, and avoid committing artifacts unless they are intentionally sanitized fixtures.

Cloud provider artifact URLs returned by `artifacts`, `close --json`, or `disconnect --json` may be provider dashboard URLs, public share links, or pre-signed download URLs. Treat the URLs themselves as sensitive credentials until you know the provider's sharing and expiry policy.

## Permissions

Some targets require local permissions or developer setup:

- iOS/tvOS/macOS automation uses Xcode tooling and may require signing or Developer Mode for physical devices.
- Android automation uses ADB and connected emulator/device trust.
- Initial Vega OS automation uses Vega CLI/VDA only with the local Vega Virtual Device; physical Fire TV control is not yet admitted.
- macOS desktop automation requires Accessibility permission, and screen capture workflows may require Screen Recording permission.

## Network and updates

Interactive CLI runs may check npm for newer `agent-device` releases and print an upgrade suggestion. Set `AGENT_DEVICE_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1` to disable the notice.

Network inspection commands only collect traffic available to the active app/session tooling. Review network artifacts before sharing because headers and payloads can contain secrets.

## Responsible disclosure

Report security issues by contacting Callstack privately at hello@callstack.com. Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability that exposes user data, credentials, device access, or remote execution risk.

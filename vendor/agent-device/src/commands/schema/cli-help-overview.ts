All ${listCliCommandNames().length} commands: agent-device help commands

Start:
  When starting a task with a known app, first run:
    agent-device open <app> --foreground
  It starts the session and returns the initial interactive snapshot with @refs.
  Do not probe first with devices, apps, appstate, snapshot, or screenshot.
  Unknown app id: devices, then apps, then open <discovered-id>. Never invent ids.
  Resuming an existing session: continue from its current state; do not reopen it.

Loop:
  press|click|fill|longpress <target> ... --settle
  hover <target> --settle (web only; reveals hover-gated UI)
  scroll <direction|top|bottom> [amount] --settle; back --settle
    acts, waits for quiet, and prints the UI diff. Continue from that diff.
    Run snapshot -i only when the diff lacks the next target or did not settle.
  Verify a named expectation with the diff, wait text "...", wait <selector>, wait absent <selector>,
    is, get, or find. A bare screenshot is not verification.
  End with: agent-device close

Targets:
  Copy refs exactly: @e12, @e12~s4. Keep @ and any ~sN pin; refs go stale
    after mutations. A literal @handle is label="@handle", not a bare ref.
  Prefer refs, then id/label/role selectors. Selector keys: ${SELECTOR_KEY_NAMES.join(' ')}.
  Coordinates are last resort: after snapshot -i shows no semantic target, or a
    sparse/AX-unavailable warning says its refs and selectors are invalid.
    Then screenshot, press <x> <y>, and re-snapshot on the changed screen.

Rules:
  --settle is only for press/click/fill/longpress/hover/scroll/back; never open,
    snapshot, or close. type never accepts --settle.
  fill <target> <text> --settle replaces; type <text> appends after focus.
  Late network/debounce result: wait text "Expected", not snapshot polling.
  Output full agent-device commands; no pipes, grep, jq, or pseudo-commands.
  Stop when the requested end state is visible. Mutations run serially.

 * post-action observation trait must intersect `SettleCommandOptions`.
 *
 * The `Record` over the trait command union makes a missing or extra cell a
 * compile error, and the `satisfies` assignability check fails when any listed
 * option type drops its `& SettleCommandOptions` intersection — the same
 * strategy `packages/contracts/src/interaction-guarantees.ts` uses to make
 * guarantee completeness a compile error instead of a runtime assertion.

 * identical, and it is the invariant that matters: #1076 versioned refs require the observation
 * counter to advance exactly when the stored tree is replaced, for `snapshot` and `diff` alike,
 * and the scope source must describe the tree that actually ended up there.
 *
 * Advancing the counter is NOT the same as invalidating client refs, and the comment this
 * replaced said otherwise — it claimed a diff leaves refs pinned to the previous generation
 * "which is exactly what the pinned warning diagnoses". It does not: `diff` passes
 * `issuesRefsToClient: false`, so it never reactivates the frame, and
 * `resolveRefStalenessWarning` compares a pin against the frame EPOCH rather than this counter,
 * precisely so a capture that bumped the counter cannot make a valid pin look stale. A ref
 * pinned before a diff therefore keeps resolving, with no warning, by design (ADR 0014).
 * `session-snapshot.test.ts` pins that outcome so the claim cannot drift back.
 *
 * Both fields move together, here, next to the writer they have to agree with. They used to be
 * assigned at the call site, which is how the rule came to have two statements of itself in two
 * modules.

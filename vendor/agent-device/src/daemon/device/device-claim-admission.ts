/**
 * The #1320 claim gate a request passes on its way from a device binding to
 * device operations. The device-claim rule of the admitted owner decides what
 * happens here, under every policy: an ordinary owner takes a transient claim
 * only when the executing command's declared {@link DeviceClaimPolicy} is
 * `transient-exclusive`; a managed local owner is verified against its
 * allocator-held claim; a provider owner takes nothing.
 *
 * `admit` is called once per device binding by the request runtime bindings,
 * which is where per-device deduplication already lives, with the binding
 * intent the gateway bound. A command handler has no other way to obtain
 * device operations, so a handler cannot forget any of this. Two daemon-owned
 * recovery paths do bind outside the seam and are the known gap:
 * application-lifecycle-recovery.ts (ordinary intent, daemon shutdown) and
 * durable-capture-runtime-recovery.ts (exact-owner intent read back from a
 * durable envelope).

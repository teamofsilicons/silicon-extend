 * A session owns at most one **ref frame**: the namespace whose refs a caller
 * may use to target a mutation. This module is the single owner of the frame's
 * transitions and of the admission decision; the frame value itself is declared in
 * `ref-frame-slot.ts`, below this module and the session record. The frame epoch reuses
 * the existing `snapshotGeneration`/`refsGeneration` counter and the `@e12~s42` pin grammar
 * for wire compatibility.
 *
 * The frame is expired at the device side-effect seam, carries a non-`all`
 * issuance scope after a partial publication, and its admission matrix is
 * enforced fail-closed on every platform before dispatch (ADR 0014 steps 3–7).
 * Read-only ref staleness is now derived from frame state (an expired frame
 * warns; an active one does not) rather than a coarse client-stale marker, which
 * migration step 8 removed.

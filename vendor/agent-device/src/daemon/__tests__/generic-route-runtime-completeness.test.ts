 * The generic route is the router's fallthrough: a descriptor joins it by declaring

 * `app-switcher`, its last legacy leaf, so `resolveGenericRuntimeExecution` is now the route's
 * only execution path and `ensureGenericCommandReady` no longer carries a support gate behind it.
 * That totality is what these tests pin: a descriptor that joins the route without an arm would
 * otherwise reach the dispatcher through a `default` that refuses at request time.

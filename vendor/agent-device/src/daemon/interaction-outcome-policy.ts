/**
 * Baseline classifier for post-gesture baseline distrust (#1542 defect 2),
 * reusing this module's three-valued `InteractionSurfaceChange` vocabulary.
 *
 * The rule is set membership, not rect deltas on the intersection, and #1569
 * is why. A scroll does not slide shared elements to new positions — it
 * REPLACES the content. Measured on the checkout form, a `scroll down 0.6`
 * that moved the whole form left exactly five identifiers in common with its
 * baseline, and all five were tab-bar icons that by construction never move.
 * Judging such a pair by "did anything in the intersection shift" asks the
 * only elements guaranteed to sit still whether anything moved, so the honest
 * signal is that the content set itself differs.
 *
 * Only entries that carry an `identity` participate. Anonymous layout nodes
 * can be matched solely by ordinal position among other anonymous nodes, and
 * the two captures rarely contain the same number of them — on that same real
 * pair the previous implementation's entire "movement" evidence was six such
 * aliased entries reporting deltas of -920, +37 and -7 px for a ~500px scroll.
 * Structural chrome (viewport root, keyboard) is excluded for the older reason
 * that its rect is invariant under any gesture.
 *
 * Set difference alone would mistake scope drift for movement: the baseline and
 * the quiet capture are routinely fetched by different callers with different
 * snapshot scopes (a broad text search vs. an interactive-only capture), and
 * the narrower one is then a strict SUBSET of the broader. Replacement is what
 * separates the two — a scroll leaves each side holding content the other
 * lacks, while scope drift only ever removes from one side.
 *
 * - `'changed'`: each side holds identified content the other does not (the
 *   surface was replaced), or a surviving element moved beyond tolerance.
 * - `'unchanged'`: everything both sides can see agrees, in the same places —
 *   the real "still showing the pre-gesture screen" signal distrust exists to
 *   catch. A one-sided difference lands here: it is scope, not movement.
 * - `'ambiguous'`: a side carries no identified content, or the two share none,
 *   so there is nothing comparable. Never treated as a match.
 *
 * Both signatures must come from the same snapshot backend; the caller owns
 * that invariant (see `deferred-interaction-outcome.ts`). Backends disagree about
 * which nodes exist, so a cross-backend pair differs for reasons that have
 * nothing to do with the gesture.

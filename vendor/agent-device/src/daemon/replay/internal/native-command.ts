/**
 * #1555 P5 (decomposition): the replay request's own orchestration — routing, plan resolution,
 * session preparation, the engine step loop, and run completion — kept thin by extracting the
 * three cohesive pieces it drives into their own modules:
 *  - the plan-side helpers (`validateReplayBackendFlag`, `inspectReplayPlanManifest`,
 *    `resolveReplayPlanEntryIndex`, `routeMaestroReplay`, and `prepareReplayPlan` itself) live in
 *    `session-replay-runtime-plan.ts`, alongside the digest/resume metadata helper that was
 *    already there.
 *  - session preparation (the R2 repair preflight, resume-state consumption, and save-script
 *    arming) lives in `session-replay-runtime-session.ts`.
 *  - the `AdReplayStepRuntime` engine adapter (`createAdReplayStepRuntime`, its `build*Failure`
 *    capability implementations, and the `lastResponse`/`lastObservation` side-map mechanics)
 *    lives in `session-replay-runtime-engine-adapter.ts`.
 * This file is what remains: the one place `runReplayCommand` composes them, and the run's
 * completion (`completeReplayRun`/`requireLiveSessionForKeepSession`), which runs after the engine
 * loop returns and never touches the step runtime itself.
 *
 * Coordinator ownership is unchanged by this split: `createReplayCoordinator` is still called
 * here, and only here — see `src/daemon/__tests__/replay-coordinator-ownership.test.ts` — every
 * extracted module receives the already-constructed `ReplayCoordinator` as a parameter instead of
 * constructing its own.
 */

/**
 * #1802: the run's script text arrives IN THE REQUEST (a replay script source
 * bundle the caller read and resolved), never as a path this process opens.
 * That is why this is `runReplayCommand` and no longer the old
 * `…ScriptFile`: a remote daemon shares no filesystem with the caller,
 * so a handler that opened `req.positionals[0]` could only ever work when the
 * two happened to be the same host.

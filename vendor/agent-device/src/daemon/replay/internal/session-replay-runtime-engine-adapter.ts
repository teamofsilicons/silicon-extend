 * #1555 P5 (decomposition): the daemon's `AdReplayStepRuntime` adapter — extracted verbatim out

 * `createAdReplayStepRuntime`. See that file's `runReplayCommand` for the request-level
 * orchestration this adapter plugs into.
 *
 * The wire-narrowing concern (guard threading, `details` bag -> typed
 * evidence, dispatch-failure classification) lives in
 * `session-replay-dispatch-narrowing.ts` — a real seam with one nameable job.
 * Everything else the factory's capabilities delegate to (the step context
 * shape, failure wrapping, progress display, diagnostics sampling) lives
 * below in this file: a briefly-extracted `-step-support` module was folded
 * back after review judged it a size-target fragment, not a concern boundary
 * — this adapter's honest size is ~430 lines, renegotiated from the plan's
 * <300 metric on #1478.

/**
 * #1478 P5 stage C2b (narrowed further by the #1555 review's neutral-outcomes
 * pass, then again by the R3 pass that moved verify-then-dispatch into the
 * engine): the daemon's `AdReplayStepRuntime` adapter — the narrow
 * routing/capture/classify/dispatch/build-failure capability bag
 * `runAdReplay`'s step loop threads through. Every member closes over this
 * one request's `ReplayStepContext` (or the outer accumulators it needs to
 * keep in sync); none of it is reachable from the engine except through these
 * functions — the engine drives WHEN each one is called and, for the four
 * target-verification policy decisions, WHAT it means; this adapter only
 * knows HOW to do each daemon-owned piece.
 *
 * `lastResponse` is the side-map the neutral-outcomes design relies on: the
 * ONLY place a real `DaemonResponse` is built or held. Every capability that
 * can end a step (`dispatchStep`, the three `build*Failure` capabilities, and
 * `handleActionFailure`) records the wire response it just built here before
 * projecting it down to the neutral `AdReplayStepOutcome`/`AdReplayStepFailure`
 * the engine actually sees; `readLastResponse` lets `runReplayCommand`
 * recover the exact final response once `runAdReplay` reports which step
 * failed, so the client-visible wire output never changes even though the
 * engine itself never touches it.
 *
 * `lastObservation` is the analogous side-map for `buildTargetBindingFailure`
 * — it reuses the SAME capture `captureObservation` just took (for its
 * `screen`), mirroring the pre-R3 code's single-capture-serves-both-paths
 * invariant instead of taking a second, possibly-different snapshot.
 *
 * #1555 structural-quality review ("fix lastObservation to be genuinely
 * per-step"): both this closure and `armStep` live for the whole RUN (one
 * `createAdReplayStepRuntime` call covers every step), so an un-reset
 * `lastObservation` would silently carry a PREVIOUS step's capture into a
 * step that somehow reached `buildTargetBindingFailure` without its own
 * `captureObservation` call first — the `?? { reason: 'observation-missing'
 * }` fallback below exists to name that condition, but could never actually
 * fire for it; it would instead attach a stale, wrong-step screen. `armStep`
 * runs exactly once per step, before any of this step's capabilities do —
 * clearing `lastObservation` there makes the fallback message correct for
 * ANY future call ordering, not just the current one where every
 * `buildTargetBindingFailure` call site happens to be preceded by this same
 * step's own `captureObservation`.

/**
 * ADR 0012 decision 6, R3: the daemon-side `repairHint` computation.
 *
 * Computed daemon-side at divergence time, never by the agent, from (i) the
 * recorded `target-v1` evidence for the diverged action (decision 3's
 * `ancestry`/`scrollRegion`) and (ii) the divergence's own FULL capture —
 * the daemon's own tree, never the flat, 20-capped `screen.refs` wire
 * projection. A target-binding kind's capture is the PRE-action tree;
 * `action-failure` (PR #1223's dispatch-thrown path) captures AFTER the
 * failed response, so its capture is the POST-response tree. The mapping is
 * TOTAL: every (`kind` x evidence-presence x capture-availability) triple
 * resolves to a defined enum, with two fail-safes to `manual` — no recorded
 * evidence, or a sparse/unavailable capture — so `repairHint` is always
 * defined.
 *
 * Lives in the daemon zone because the container-presence test
 * below is a genuine structural containment check over `parentIndex` — the
 * same tree-walking machinery decision 3's own identity-set filter uses
 * (`buildAncestryChain`/`computeScrollRegionKey`, `@agent-device/selectors/target-evidence`)
 * — not a flat identity-string search.

 * which is true on nearly every screen and would falsely route an unrelated
 * screen to `record-and-heal` (the exact mis-binding decision 1 retired

 * deliberately carries none, to pin the daemon's refusal) is returned untouched.
 *
 * Collection that cannot succeed — a case driving `replay` at a path that deliberately does not
 * exist — leaves the request alone rather than throwing: the real client raises that failure at
 * the CLI boundary (pinned in `cli-client-commands.test.ts`), and a daemon-level harness must
 * still deliver the request so the daemon's own response is what the case observes.

// Real-scope same-device serialization guard for the concurrency torture lane
// (#1416). The seeded sweep models the mutex GRANT (a seed cannot reproduce
// `withKeyedLock`'s native microtask hand-off), so on its own it could stay
// green if the PRODUCTION lock APPLICATION path regressed. This guard closes
// that gap by driving two concurrent requests for the SAME device through the
// real `createRequestExecutionScope().runLocked()` — i.e. the actual
// `withRequestExecutionLocks` → `withKeyedLock` machinery, not a model — and
// asserting their critical sections never overlap. It is intentionally NOT
// seeded: it exercises real event-loop scheduling. Disabling production locking
// (`shouldLockSessionExecution` → false, or dropping the `device:` key) makes
// two sections overlap and trips this assertion.

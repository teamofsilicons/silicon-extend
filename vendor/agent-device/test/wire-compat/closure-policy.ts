/**
 * What the wire-surface closure is allowed to stop at (#1432, review P1).
 *
 * The closure walk fails closed: every type name a listed declaration
 * references must resolve to a listed declaration, or to an entry here. There
 * is no silent skip, because the silent skip WAS the defect — a listed type
 * could grow `foo?: ImportedShape` from an unlisted module and stay green.
 *
 * Two kinds of stop, kept apart because they are different claims:
 *
 * - an EXTERNAL MODULE is outside this repository, so there is no declaration
 *   to digest and no way for a change to it to ship in our tarball;
 * - a WAIVER is a repo declaration the walk reaches that is genuinely not
 *   payload — transport plumbing, a local error class, a callback type. Each
 *   one is a claim someone has to defend in review, which is the point.
 *
 * A waiver stops the walk. If a waived type later starts carrying payload,
 * moving it into `surface.ts` is the fix, not widening this file.

  // These types are the CLI-SIDE projection. They do not cross the boundary as
  // typed fields: DaemonRequest carries `input?: Record<string, unknown>` and
  // `flags?: Record<string, unknown>`, both listed, and the flag vocabulary
  // lands inside those bags as plain keys. ADR 0006 then classifies a new flag
  // as additive ("new optional request fields or flags that older daemons can
  // ignore or reject with a normal command error"), explicitly NOT a bump. So
  // digesting them would fire the gate on every new CLI flag for a change the
  // decision says needs no acknowledgment — and a gate that cries wolf gets
  // its acks rubber-stamped, which costs more than the coverage buys.
  //
  // If a flag ever becomes a typed field on DaemonRequest, that changes
  // DaemonRequest's own digest, and the right fix is to list the type here
  // rather than widen this waiver.

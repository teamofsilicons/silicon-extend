/**
 * Planted-red proofs: does the gate actually catch each class of wire break?
 * (#1432, review P1.)
 *
 * The ledger and closure tests prove the manifest describes today's source.
 * They cannot prove the manifest describes the RIGHT source — a gate can list
 * 117 declarations, pass every check, and still miss the seam that breaks a
 * skewed peer. So each case below mutates one real listed declaration the way
 * a real break would, and asserts the digest moves.
 *
 * Two guards keep these from going vacuous, which is the standing failure mode
 * for regression tests here (AGENTS.md: "a green check is evidence only once
 * you have seen it red"):
 *
 * 1. every mutation must actually change the source it is applied to, so a
 *    renamed field silently turning the replacement into a no-op fails loudly
 *    rather than passing on an unmutated digest;
 * 2. the unmutated digest must equal the ledger's, so the case is pinned to
 *    the declaration the gate really watches rather than to a stale copy.
 *
 * They run against source text in memory. Nothing on disk is modified.

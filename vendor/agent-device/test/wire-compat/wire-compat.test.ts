/**
 * Daemon RPC wire-surface gate, offline half (#1432).
 *
 * ADR 0006 fixes when `DAEMON_RPC_PROTOCOL_VERSION` must be bumped and until
 * now nothing checked it. This lane is the tripwire: it fails the moment a
 * declaration the manifest calls wire surface changes shape, naming the symbol
 * and printing the digest to paste. It needs no history and no network, so it
 * runs in `unit-core` on every PR.
 *
 * It deliberately cannot tell a bump from an ack — both look like an edited
 * ledger from a single commit. `pnpm check:daemon-wire-compat` answers that
 * half against the last RELEASED tag, which is the only baseline ADR 0006 and
 * #1432 accept.

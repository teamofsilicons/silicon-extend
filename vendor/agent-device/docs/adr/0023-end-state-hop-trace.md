# ADR-0023: end-state entry-to-platform hop trace

Backs the "Entry-to-platform hop count" paragraph in
[0019-request-bound-platform-runtime.md](./0019-request-bound-platform-runtime.md#end-state-proposed-2026-09-02-maintainer-decision-pending).
That paragraph cited 38 hops (`press`/Android) and 29 hops (`snapshot`/iOS) with no ordered
route, no counting definition, and no linked artifact. This file supplies all three.

The 23/24 tables originally recorded here at `132ffe1da` (corrected for PR #2302 in that PR)
are superseded: the routes moved ~58 commits, `snapshot`/iOS is now a dual-arm route, and the
#2278 audit re-traced both routes file-by-file at HEAD with a role vocabulary. This revision
replaces the tables and keeps the counting definition stable so the numbers remain comparable.
A follow-up revision re-traced the request spine: the auth token comparison, the request
cancellation gate, the idle-reap timer reset, and the Android freshness guard/clear are
side-calls (guards and liveness bookkeeping), not the call that continues toward the platform
boundary, so they are not hops. The tables and every derived number below are recomputed under
that reading.

## Counting definition

- **Unit**: one distinct production `.ts` file entered on the call path, counted once even if
  re-entered (a lazy `import()` of an already-counted file is not a new hop). Type-only imports
  and files that only supply types are not hops.
- **Range**: from the daemon's HTTP entry file (`src/daemon/server/http-server.ts`) through the
  file that issues the concrete platform call, inclusive of both endpoints. For `press`/Android
  that is the serial-scoped `adb shell input tap` invocation; for `snapshot`/iOS it is the
  `socket.write` to the in-simulator AX bridge (primary arm) or the `fetch()` to the XCTest
  runner (fallback arm).
- **Main chain only**: follow the first call that continues toward the platform call (not every
  branch — e.g. `handleSnapshotCommands` routes `alert`/`settings`/`diff`/`wait` too; only the
  plain-`snapshot` arm is traced). Side-calls that build data records inside a hop (e.g. the
   `*RuntimeOperationFacts` builders inside the owner's per-request `inspectFacts`) are not hops;
   they are measured as admission fan-out below. Guards and liveness side-effects on the request
   spine are not hops either: the auth token comparison (`timingSafeStringEqual`), the request
   cancellation gate (`throwIfRequestCanceled`), the idle-reap timer reset (`cancel()`), and the
   Android freshness guard/clear run on every request as sibling statements of the continuation,
   not as the call that advances toward the platform. Files executing only on the response path
   (after the platform call, on the way back) are not hops; they are counted separately — the
   freshness clear is one such response-path call.
- **Steady state**: the `snapshot` fallback arm is traced with the runner session already up.
  The cold-start chain (lease, xctestrun build via xcodebuild, process launch) is a fork, not
  the traced path.
- **Per-file role** (exactly one):
  - **policy** — makes an admission/limit/retry/routing decision that can refuse or redirect the request.
  - **orchestration** — coordinates multiple calls, binds/runs a runtime, or assembles the object graph the next hops need.
  - **translation** — maps values/shapes (argv construction, wire encoding, target resolution) without issuing the platform call.
  - **adapter** — wraps an external system boundary (subprocess, socket, fetch). The terminal hop is the adapter that issues the platform call itself.
  - **pass-through** — delegates to exactly one next call on the traced path with no branching or transformation (lazy-load indirection, one-line re-export/delegate, scope wrapper).
- **Deletion test** (per pass-through/translation hop): could this hop's hand-off be inlined
  into its caller and/or callee without losing admission, budget, isolation, a declared
  boundary named in an ADR, or a testability seam? The test judges the hop, not the file: a
  REMOVABLE hop is a collapse candidate, not a file to delete.
- **Method**: read each file, find the exported entry function reached by the caller, follow
  its first call that continues toward the platform call, record the file and the one
  function that hands off to the next hop.
- **Commit measured at**: `27a97ee619` (re-traced for #2278; supersedes the `132ffe1da` tables).

## `press` / Android: HTTP entry → `adb input tap`

41 files: 11 pass-through, 5 translation, 5 policy, 19 orchestration, 1 terminal (adapter).

The request spine also runs side-calls that are not hops — they execute on every request but are
not the call that continues toward the platform boundary: `src/daemon/server/daemon-idle-reap.ts`
(`cancel()` resets the liveness timer as a sibling of `dispatchRequest`),
`packages/host-kit/src/internal/transport.ts` (`timingSafeStringEqual` compares the auth token
before the continuation), and `packages/host-kit/src/internal/request-cancel.ts`
(`throwIfRequestCanceled` gates the `task()` continuation inside `runLocked`/`runAdmitted`).

| 41 | `src/platform-runtime-android-adb-host.ts` | `execSerialAdb` issues the serial-scoped tap invocation | **terminal (adapter)** | n/a (terminal) |

The terminal's invocation is spawned through host-kit's shared `runCmd`
(`packages/host-kit/src/internal/command.ts`, the generic subprocess adapter shared with the
`snapshot` route — counted there, not a separate hop here). Precedent: at the baseline
measurement the terminal was the route-level issue point (`adb.ts`) even though the spawn lived
in the executor below it; the same boundary is `adb-host` at HEAD (the named root file bound
only by its named composition module per ADR Decision §1).

**Admission fan-out (not hops).** The android owner's per-request `inspectFacts`
(`packages/platform-android/src/runtime.ts`) executes 23 distinct
`packages/contracts/src/*-runtime.ts` `*RuntimeOperationFacts` builders as side-calls:
`application-lifecycle`, `alert`, `app-event`, `app-switcher`, `audio-probe`, `back`,
`clipboard`, `element-text`, `focus`, `gesture`, `home`, `keyboard`, `orientation`, `perf`,
`screenshot`, `scroll`, `selector-observation`, `settings`, `snapshot`, `touch`, `type-text`,
`tv-remote`, `viewport` (each `-runtime.ts`).

**Response path (not hops).** 8 files execute only after the platform call:
`src/daemon/interaction/internal/interaction-touch-response.ts`,
`src/daemon/interaction/internal/interaction-common.ts`,
`src/daemon/interaction-outcome-policy.ts`, `src/daemon/request-finalization.ts`,
`src/daemon/session-event-log.ts`, `src/daemon/session-snapshot.ts`,
`src/daemon/recording-gestures.ts`, `src/daemon/deferred-interaction-outcome.ts`.

**Forks not followed**: `request-platform-provider-context.ts` (the call is guarded by the
router's early return for a bare local daemon — zero runtimes + non-web),
`platform-runtime/request-providers.ts` (only under `requestPlatformProviders.run`, not called
for local), `lease-registry.ts` (`isHumanControlMutation` is false for an agent-surface press),
the `@ref`/direct-iOS fast paths in `interaction-touch-press.ts`, the provider-adb arm in
`adb-provider-scope.ts`, and the error-path arms in `adb-failure.ts`/`adb-host.ts`.

## `snapshot` / iOS Simulator: HTTP entry → AX bridge `socket.write` (primary) / runner `fetch` (fallback)

The route forks at `packages/platform-apple/src/snapshot-route.ts` (`route.capture`,
`isEligible` + per-generation circuit breaker): the in-simulator AX bridge is the primary arm;
the XCTest runner is the fallback (chosen when ineligible, on AX acquisition failure, or when
the single-flight target discovery — `TARGET_DISCOVERY_WAIT_MS` bounded wait in
`snapshot-target.ts` — has not settled for this capture; the probe keeps running and later
captures join it).
Shared prefix 30 files; primary arm 47 distinct (30 + 17); fallback arm 49 distinct
(30 + 19); 66 distinct files across the union. The request spine's side-calls — the idle-reap
reset, the auth comparison, the cancellation gate, and the Android freshness guard/clear
(`src/daemon/session-snapshot-freshness.ts`, a guard read plus a post-capture clear that no-ops
on iOS) — run on this prefix as siblings of the continuation and are not counted.

Re-entry: arm B #4 enters `packages/platform-apple/src/index.ts` (shared #22) via
`applePlugin.createInteractor` — counted once.

**Admission fan-out (not hops).** The apple owner's per-request `inspectFacts`
(`packages/platform-apple/src/runtime.ts`) executes the same 23
`packages/contracts/src/*-runtime.ts` `*RuntimeOperationFacts` builders as the android owner
above, as side-calls of the admission step.

**Response path (not hops).** 22 files execute only after the platform call:
`src/daemon/ref-frame.ts`, `src/daemon/session-action-recorder.ts`,
`src/daemon/snapshot-quality-latch.ts`, `src/daemon/request-finalization.ts`,
`src/daemon/session-event-request.ts`, `src/daemon/session-snapshot.ts` (lineage),
`src/daemon/sparse-fallback-screenshot.ts`, `src/core/snapshot-state.ts`,
`packages/contracts/src/capture.ts`, `packages/platform-apple/src/runner/snapshot-presentation.ts`,
`src/snapshot/ios-snapshot-runtime.ts`, the `packages/capture-kit/src/ios-snapshot-engine/`
modules (engine, invariants, geometry, geometry-policy, projection, graph,
runner-presentation), `packages/capture-kit/src/ios-snapshot-planning.ts`,
`packages/capture-kit/src/snapshot-quality-verdict.ts`,
`packages/contracts/src/snapshot-scope.ts`,
`packages/platform-apple/src/snapshot-source/tree.ts`.

**Forks not followed**: `request-platform-provider-context.ts` (router early return for a bare
local daemon), `platform-runtime/request-providers.ts`, `lease-registry.ts`
(`isHumanControlMutation` false for an agent-surface snapshot), the `alert`/`settings`/`diff`/
`wait` arms in `handlers/snapshot.ts`, the macOS surface-capture arms, the
`selector-*`/`custom-actions-*` plan arms in `snapshot-runtime-binding.ts`, and the arm B
**cold-start chain** (steady-state session exists): `startRunnerSessionWithLease` in
`runner-session.ts` into ~15 `packages/platform-apple/src/runner/` files
(`runner-lease`, `runner-adoption`, `runner-artifact`, `runner-artifact-env`, `runner-cache`,
`runner-cache-metadata`, `runner-device-set`, `runner-process-launch`, `runner-listener-ready`,
`runner-io`, `runner-source`, `runner-session-types`, `runner-macos-products`, `runner-icon`,
`runner-xctestrun` products) plus host-kit `exec`/`atomic-file`/`host-process` — the xctestrun
build, process launch, and listener-ready observation.

## Why this differs from the ADR's 38/29

The façade PRs the plan sheet named as a candidate explanation (#2178, #2222, #2232) all merged
**before** `e624ef9d3f` — the commit the ADR cites for its 38/29 measurement — so they cannot be
why that count is higher than this one; they were already in effect when 38/29 was recorded.

This trace lands at 41 hops for `press`/Android and 47/49 (per arm) for `snapshot`/iOS. The ADR
text names no ordered chain, command/artifact, or counting definition for 38/29, so the
discrepancy cannot be resolved against it. The most likely explanation is a different counting
unit (for example, named exports or every static/type import touched rather than distinct
production files on the call path). **Treat 38 and 29 as superseded by the auditable numbers
measured here**, not as a second data point to reconcile.

## Delta vs the 23/24 measured at `132ffe1da`

Both routes kept their old files (nothing on the old routes was dropped: the snapshot
`register-builtins.ts` lookup moved from call-time to module-load registration, with
`platform-plugin-registry.ts` taking the call-time role). The growth is four clusters:

1. **Request-scope wrapper layer** (6 new spine files, both routes): `daemon-runtime.ts`,
   host-kit `diagnostics`, `device-inventory-context.ts`, `dispatch-resolve.ts`,
   `request-execution-scope.ts`, `provider-device-runtime.ts`. The old 3-file router spine
   (`http-server` → `request-router` → `request-handler-chain`) is now 9 files: diagnostics
   scoping, inventory/resolution contexts, execution scope/locks, and provider-scope isolation
   moved into the router's request path. The auth token comparison, the cancellation gate, and
   the idle-reap timer reset ride on that path as side-calls, not hops.
2. **AgentDevice command layer** (press rows 24–30, snapshot shared 26–29): commands now
   execute through the bound AgentDevice surface (`src/runtime.ts`, `src/commands/**`,
   `interaction-runtime.ts`) between the daemon dispatch and the platform interactor.
3. **adb host split + claim gate** (press rows 23, 39–41): `device-claim-admission.ts`,
   `adb-provider-scope.ts`, `adb-failure.ts`, and the named-root `platform-runtime-android-adb-host.ts`
   terminal (the package `adb.ts` is now a pass-through executor seam).
4. **Snapshot dual arms** (snapshot): the in-simulator AX bridge became the primary capture
   path (arm A: `snapshot-source/*`, target/process/simctl resolution, host-kit process
   adapters), the XCTest runner demoted to fallback (arm B), and the runner protocol deepened
   (`runner-command-traits`, `runner-contract`, `runner-recycle-ledger`,
   `runner-startup-transport`) while the presentation work moved to the response path
   (capture-kit engine).

## The ≤14 target

Re-derived at HEAD under the same collapsing logic the earlier revision applied (fold every
pass-through hop with no kept depth):

- **`press`/Android — no longer plausible.** The fixed request spine alone (rows 1–9) is 9
  files, and every one of them either passes the deletion test with kept depth (diagnostics
  attribution, inventory/resolution context, execution scope, provider scope) or is a declared
  boundary. Every remaining pass-through hop keeps depth (declared boundaries, the interactor
  resolution seam, the adb executor seam and typed failure classification), so reaching ≤14
  would require cutting 27 files that are cross-cutting daemon concerns or load-bearing
  bindings, not press-specific waste.
- **`snapshot`/iOS — not reachable.** The shared prefix alone is 30 files, and the primary arm
  adds 16 non-terminal hops of the AX-bridge protocol (binary cache, session lock, wire codec,
  deadline budgets); the fallback arm's runner protocol (retry, contract, recycle ledger,
  readiness) remains load-bearing. The only REMOVABLE hop is shared row 28
  (`commands/runtime-types`, thin closure wrapper): 47/49 → 46/48.

**Verdict: the ≤14 target is superseded.** The audited routes at `27a97ee619` are 41
(`press`/Android) and 47/49 (`snapshot`/iOS per arm), and the deletion test proves a single
distinct removable hop across both routes (`commands/runtime-types.ts`). Collapsing that one is
the only hop-depth reduction the audit endorses; any further target needs a decision to fold
cross-cutting request-scope wrappers, which is outside this route's ownership. Treat 14 as a
historical discussion anchor, not as a derived number.

# ADR 0011: Interaction Guarantee Contract (path × guarantee matrix)

## Status

Accepted (implemented through Layer 3, 2026-07-04: #1080, #1082–#1086, #1091, #1092; ambiguity contract amended 2026-08-07)

## Context

Interaction commands (`press`/`click`/`fill`/`longpress`, and by extension the
read/wait surfaces built on the same resolution machinery) reach the device
through several dispatch paths, each of which chose its latency-vs-semantics
trade-offs independently:

| Path | What it is | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime-selector` | daemon tree capture → `resolveSelectorChain` → guards → coordinate tap | full semantics |
| `runtime-ref` | session snapshot → ref lookup → guards → coordinate tap | full semantics |
| `target-drag` | independently resolve source + destination → guards → one pointer plan | dual-endpoint drag semantics |
| `direct-ios-selector` | selector sent to the XCTest runner, which queries and taps natively | saves a full snapshot round trip |
| `native-ref` | `backend.tapTarget`/`fillTarget` for `click @ref` / `fill @ref` | saves resolution round trips |
| `coordinate` | raw x/y tap | escape hatch; semantics intentionally minimal |
| replay/maestro variants | `allowNonHittableCoordinateFallback`, replay-heal | third-party compat |

Over one week of fixes, every interaction bug we shipped or caught was the same
shape — a guarantee enforced on one path and silently absent on a sibling:

- off-screen refusal existed for `@ref` targets but not selector targets, and
  not in the runner's native tap (Bluesky closed drawer: `Tapped (-161, 265)`
  reported as success; fixed in #1075);
- `--verify` evidence attached on `press @ref` but was dropped by
  `fill @ref`'s hand-built response branch (#1064 review);
- adb failure classification enriched thrown errors but not
  `allowFailure`-result errors, and wrapped `exec` but not semantic provider
  methods (#1067 review);
- the user's wait budget bounded prepare/replay/snapshot request envelopes but
  not `wait` itself, and `wait` sat on the daemon-reset timeout path while
  `snapshot` — same failure mode — preserved the daemon (#1075).

The guarantees themselves are small and well-implemented. What is missing is
any structure that *knows the full set of paths and the full set of
guarantees* and can therefore notice an unfilled cell. Reviews catch cells
only when a reviewer happens to hold both axes in their head; dogfooding
catches them one production incident at a time.

## Decision

Make the path × guarantee matrix a first-class, machine-checked artifact, with
three enforcement layers. Types enforce **completeness** of declarations,
shared implementations prevent **drift**, and generated test coverage enforces
**truth**.

### Layer 1 — Declare: the matrix as a typed registry with a gate

Layer 1 is an **honesty/completeness gate, not a truth gate**: it proves that
every path has declared a stance on every guarantee and that the referenced
implementations exist. It does not prove the declared behavior — behavioral
parity only starts once the fixture tables (Layer 2) and contract scenarios
(Layer 3) land. Landing Layer 1 alone still changes the failure mode: an
unwatched cell becomes impossible; an unproven cell is at least a visible,
owned claim.

`packages/contracts/src/interaction-guarantees.ts` declares both axes and requires
every cell to be classified:

```ts
export const INTERACTION_GUARANTEES = [
  'disambiguation',        // collapse one equivalent wrapper chain; distinct subtrees fail with candidates
  'occlusion',             // covered targets are refused
  'offscreen',             // tap point (rect center) must lie in the root viewport
  'nonHittable',           // promotion + targetHittable/hint annotation
  'responseConstruction',  // one shared response construction site (Layer 2)
  'responseIdentity',      // refLabel/selectorChain availability on this path
  'verifyEvidence',        // --verify baseline + post-action digest
  'errorTaxonomy',         // no-match/ambiguous/offscreen codes, messages, hints
] as const;
```

Cells may be **command-scoped** via `appliesTo` when a guarantee only exists
for a subset of the path's commands — e.g. `verifyEvidence` applies to
`press`/`click`/`fill` but not `longpress`, and claiming it path-wide would
overstate coverage. The gate rejects `appliesTo` entries naming commands the
path does not dispatch, and rejects redundant full-coverage lists.

`responseConstruction` and `responseIdentity` are deliberately separate: "use
one shared construction site" and "which identity fields this path can
provide" have different closure strategies (the former is a single Layer-2
refactor; the latter is per-path capability work). `errorTaxonomy` is expected
to split the same way later — stable codes/fallback classification vs rich
selector diagnostics and hints — because direct runner paths can close codes
long before full diagnostics.

```ts

export type GuaranteeEnforcement =
  | { kind: 'runtime'; via: string }                    // shared TS implementation (symbol name)
  | { kind: 'runner'; via: string; parityTable?: string } // Swift twin; parityTable optional until Layer 3, required once the cell claims parity
  | { kind: 'delegated'; to: InteractionPathId }        // path defers (e.g. direct → runtime on ELEMENT_OFFSCREEN)
  | { kind: 'waived'; reason: string; trackingIssue?: string }; // explicit, reviewed waiver; gap waivers must carry a tracking issue

export const INTERACTION_DISPATCH_PATHS: Record<
  InteractionPathId,
  {
    description: string;
    commands: readonly string[];
    guarantees: Record<InteractionGuarantee, GuaranteeEnforcement>;
  }
> = { /* every path, every cell */ };
```

Because `guarantees` is a `Record` over the guarantee union, **tsc fails** the
moment someone adds a guarantee without classifying it for every path, or adds
a path without classifying every guarantee. A unit gate
(`interaction-guarantees.test.ts`) additionally checks that:

- every `via` string resolves to a real exported symbol (declarations cannot
  rot into fiction);
- every `parityTable` names an existing fixture file;
- every `waived` reason is non-empty, and every `gap:` waiver carries a
  `trackingIssue` — waivers must be owned, not merely visible. One umbrella
  tracking issue with sub-issues split off as work is scheduled is
  sufficient; the gate enforces the link, not the granularity.

This is the same "make the gap declare itself" pattern already proven in this
repo by `scripts/integration-progress-model.ts` (which caught the unclassified
`--verify` flag on #1064) and the cross-command apple-leak guard from the
platform consolidation (ADR 0009).

### Layer 2 — Share: one implementation per rule, on both sides of the wire

Each guarantee has exactly one home that all TS paths import (most already
exist after #1075: `isNodeVisibleOnScreen`, `accumulateDisambiguationCandidate`,
`isSnapshotNodeInteractionBlocked`, `describeResolvedNode`,
`interactionResultExtra`, `reconcileNonHittableHintWithEvidence`). The
registry's `via` fields point at them; fallow's duplication gate keeps
re-implementations from creeping back.

Rules that must run **runner-side** (the direct iOS path cannot see the daemon
tree) get pure-function Swift twins operating on plain geometry — no
`XCUIElement` — e.g. `TapPointPolicy.isAllowed(elementFrame:windowFrame:)`.
Parity is enforced by **golden fixture tables**: JSON files under
`contracts/fixtures/` consumed by three test suites —

1. vitest asserts the TS rule over the table;
2. the runner's Swift unit tests (already compiled in CI by "Swift Runner Unit
   Compile") assert the Swift twin over the same table;
3. the provider harness's fake runner derives its behavior from the same
   table, so integration scenarios exercise the real contract rather than a
   hand-written approximation.

Drift between TS and Swift then turns CI red on whichever side changed,
without needing a simulator.

For `responseFields`, one `buildInteractionResponseData(...)` becomes the only
construction site for interaction response payloads (this deletes the class of
bug where `fill @ref` rebuilt its response by hand and dropped `evidence`). A
small guard test — repo-precedented — fails if an interaction handler contains
a hand-rolled `responseData = {` literal.

### Layer 3 — Prove: a contract suite generated from the registry

`test/integration/interaction-contract/` holds table-driven scenarios: fixture
tree × command × forced path. The fixture trees are the real shapes that found
this week's bugs, kept permanently:

- closed drawer (all candidates off-screen) → `offscreen_selector`/`offscreen_ref`;
- stale or unknown `@ref` (errorTaxonomy) → `ref_not_found` beside the stale-ref hint; a listed
  `@ref` whose node has no usable centre (missing, non-finite, or negative bounds), or a selector
  target without one → `target_bounds_invalid`; a listed `@ref` with no label to wait on or scope
  by → `ref_unlabeled`;
- drawer item + visible twin (ambiguous on/off-screen) → visible candidate wins;
- edge-grazing container (0.07 px viewport overlap, center off-screen) → still refused;
- covered node → occlusion refusal;
- non-hittable target ± `--verify` → hint present / suppressed by evidence;
- stripped-root tree (no Application/Window) → safe-default visibility.

Path forcing is explicit (`AGENT_DEVICE_FORCE_INTERACTION_PATH=runtime|direct|native-ref`,
test-only) so cases stay stable when path-selection heuristics change.

The gate closes the loop: it walks the Layer-1 registry and fails when any
non-waived cell has no contract case tagged for it. Coverage of the matrix is
therefore by construction, not by reviewer memory.

### Closing the gaps: a hybrid strategy, not one answer

The acknowledged gaps close by different mechanisms depending on what the
guarantee needs:

- **Runner-side parity for cheap geometry-local rules** (offscreen /
  tappable-frame on the direct iOS path). These are pure frame math, provable
  with golden tables, and keep the fast path fast.
- **Delegation-on-error for semantic and rich-runtime cases**
  (`ELEMENT_OFFSCREEN`, `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH`, `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND`, non-hittable
  refusal): the fast path fails cheaply, and the runtime path supplies
  disambiguation and full diagnostics only when needed. **Delegation-on-error
  is not success-path parity**: it cannot catch the case where XCTest finds
  one hittable candidate that runtime rules would refuse or rank differently.
  Those cells stay `gap:` waivers until parity tables or contract scenarios
  prove the success path too.
- **A shared runtime preflight for the native-ref path**: the ref came from a
  daemon snapshot, so the node is already in hand — check offscreen /
  occlusion / non-hittable against it *before* calling
  `tapTarget`/`fillTarget`. A backend fast path can silently "succeed", so
  delegation-on-error would never trigger there.

### Timeout policy joins the descriptor registry

The `wait` timeout bug existed because request-envelope budgets and
on-timeout daemon policy lived in two hand-maintained lists in the client
(`isExplicitTimeoutCommand`, `shouldResetDaemonAfterRequestTimeout`). Both are
replaced by declarations on the command descriptors (ADR 0008 registry):

```ts
timeoutPolicy: {
  budget: { source: 'flag' | 'positional-parser' | 'none'; parser?: string };
  onTimeout: 'preserve-daemon' | 'reset-daemon';
}
```

with a completeness gate over all public commands. Read-only polling commands
declare `preserve-daemon`; the client derives the envelope from the declared
budget source instead of special-casing command names. Since #1105 the
capture-resolving interaction commands (`click`, `fill`, `longpress`, `press`,
`type`, `get`, `is`) also declare `preserve-daemon`: their dominant timeout
mode is the same blocked accessibility capture as `snapshot`, and resetting
the daemon there destroyed every healthy app session the daemon owned.

## Consequences

- Adding a dispatch path or a guarantee becomes a *forced* whole-matrix
  decision: tsc will not compile an unclassified cell, and the gate will not
  pass an untested one. Silent erosion is structurally impossible; explicit
  waivers remain possible but visible and linkable to issues.
- Fast paths keep their latency wins. Their divergence is priced and
  documented instead of discovered on-device.
- The Swift/TS split stops being a parity blind spot: golden tables are the
  single source of truth for cross-language rules, and the fake runner stops
  being a second, drifting implementation.
- Initial cost is mostly classification honesty: the first registry will
  contain `waived('gap: ...')` cells (e.g. the maestro non-hittable fallback
  intentionally waives `offscreen`), which is the point — the debt becomes a
  diffable list instead of folklore.
- The registry doubles as documentation input for help/skill output ("what
  press guarantees"), which matters for small-model agents that only read the
  contract, never the code.

### 2026-08-07 amendment: mutating ambiguity fails fast

Element-14 realized the matrix's previously owned success-path gap: four exact
`Team Standup` matches in distinct accessibility subtrees reached ordinary
runtime selector resolution, whose visible/depth/area ranking silently chose a
different semantic target. Mutating selectors no longer use geometry to choose
among distinct subtrees.

The replacement contract is structural. Multiple matches collapse only when
all matches form one ancestor–descendant chain and every member resolves to the
same actionable node. Otherwise the mutation fails with `AMBIGUOUS_MATCH`, a
bounded list of snapshot candidate lines, and a partial ref frame generation so
the caller can retry one listed candidate immediately. On the direct XCTest path
this applies to mutating dispatches only: they count all raw exact matches before
hittability can select a winner and delegate multiple matches to the runtime
classifier. Reads (`querySelector`, and so `get`/`is`/`wait`) keep the prior rule
— prefer the single hittable match, ambiguous only when hittable matches compete
— because a read has no side effect to guard and failing it closed would turn a
decorative duplicate into an error. Maestro's explicit expected-point /
non-hittable compatibility path remains intentionally separate.

### 2026-09-11 amendment: one collapse for one control, at both doors

Two clauses of the amendment above went stale as the read paths moved, and the
structural rule never reached the read door.

- `querySelector` no longer backs `get`/`is`/`wait`. Those reads resolve against a
  capture, through the `readUnique`/`readAny`/`readText` rows of
  `packages/selectors/src/selector-pipeline.ts`, so the runner's hittable-preference
  rule governs only the direct XCTest paths that still query it: the direct-iOS
  touch fast path and the off-screen target probe.
- A control reported through its own accessibility wrapper answers a selector
  twice. A regular iOS snapshot omits unverified hittability, so the ladder that
  relates a wrapper to its control cannot fire, and #2482 collapsed that chain for
  mutating resolution only: `is visible` and `get attrs` refused the same screen
  as ambiguous while `press` tapped it. The collapse now sits beside the
  classification that asks for it (`resolveUnverifiedWrapperControl`) and applies
  where a refusal was the answer: the uniqueness rows — `is <predicate>`,
  `get attrs`, `screenshot --crop-on` — resolve the control instead of reporting
  no match. A row that resolves before any refusal is untouched by it, and a
  wrapper chain always resolves before one: depth separates a wrapper from its
  control, so `get text` ranks onto the control and `wait`/`is exists` answer from
  the document-order head without asking which element was meant. A candidate set
  the rule does not recognize as one control — a cell and the button inside it, or
  matches in distinct subtrees — still refuses.
- Replay verifies a recorded target by resolving its recorded selector again under
  the same row's refusal rules, so the screen dispatch had resolved read as an
  identity mismatch on the step's first replay. Verification names the collapsed
  control too, which is the node dispatch acted on and the node the recorded
  identity carries.

### Synthesized iOS gesture policy

Synthesized iOS gestures (`scroll`, synthesized coordinate `tap`, synthesized
`drag`, and synthesized `sequence` tap/drag steps) are intentionally not folded
into the element dispatch-path matrix above. They do not resolve selectors or
refs, so claiming the element-targeting guarantees would be misleading. Their
AX-health, keyboard-probe, frame-source, activation-preflight, and
XCTest-coordinate fallback rules stay runner-local in
`RunnerTests+SynthesizedGesturePolicy.swift`. That Swift policy is the source of
truth because the current table has only three behaviors:

- coordinate synthesized tap, standalone, as a `sequence` step, or as the
  in-app `back` top-leading tap, never probes keyboards and may use the
  coordinate fallback;
- default iOS scroll probes keyboards only after AX is known healthy and must
  not fall back to `XCUICoordinate`;
- synthesized one-contact `gesture` plans may still use the coordinate fallback
  before AX health is known, but stop using it once a snapshot stamps AX
  unavailable.

The non-obvious parts are covered by gated XCTest policy tests instead of a
cross-language mirror. A future sibling registry should only be introduced once
gesture policy grows beyond this small runner-local table or needs host-side
tooling to consume it directly. Synthesized coordinate contexts use screenshot
dimensions as their only frame source; cheaper frame sources such as
`app.frame`, windows, accessibility frames, or native screen bounds are
intentionally excluded because they can diverge from full-screen screenshot
coordinates on affected simulators.

Target-authored `gesture drag` is classified as the `target-drag` path above because it resolves two
elements and therefore inherits the element guarantees and ADR 0012 identity requirements for both.
Coordinate-authored drag remains outside this matrix.

Two-contact pan/pinch/rotate/transform planning is now owned by the typed
gesture-plan contract in [ADR 0013](0013-unified-gesture-plans.md). It remains a
sibling of this element-targeting matrix: coordinate gestures do not acquire
selector/ref guarantees merely because their native executor uses XCTest.

## Migration plan

Each step lands green and independently useful:

1. **Registry + gate** with an honest initial classification (waivers linked
   to issues). No behavior change.
2. **Response builder consolidation** (`buildInteractionResponseData`) + the
   hand-rolled-literal guard test.
3. **Golden fixture tables** + `TapPointPolicy` Swift extraction + the three
   consumers (vitest, XCTest, fake runner).
4. **Contract scenario suite** + registry-driven coverage gate; port the
   Bluesky fixtures from #1075's tests into the permanent tables.
5. **Descriptor timeout policy**; delete the two client-side command lists.

## Alternatives considered

- **Delete the fast paths** (single resolution spine): unacceptable — the
  direct iOS path saves a full snapshot round trip per interaction and the
  ref fast path is the backbone of replay throughput. The problem is not that
  fast paths exist; it is that their trade-offs were implicit.
- **Typestate/branded types** ("cannot construct a response without proof the
  guards ran"): cannot reach across the wire into Swift, and the proof tokens
  go viral through every signature for marginal gain over the
  registry-plus-gate split. Types are used where they are strongest —
  completeness of the declaration — and tests where they are strongest —
  truth of the declaration.
- **More integration tests without the registry**: this is the status quo
  plus effort. Without the matrix as code, nothing forces a new path to
  acquire the existing suite, which is exactly how this week's bugs happened.

### Optional observation before an iOS coordinate tap

A coordinate tap must not depend on a preceding XCTest snapshot failure. Its
optional text-input lookup may establish a concrete identity for a later bare
`type`; an absent or unavailable lookup establishes no typing witness. A runner
snapshot penalty can skip this work, but is only a performance optimization.

The lookup owns a thread-bound issue scope in the runner recorder and returns a
typed result. Any recorded issue, including one otherwise handled by AX suppression,
discards partial candidates. The scope excludes gesture dispatch and required
text-entry reads. Those failures retain the existing mutation-outcome rules.

The iOS PR lane exercises a fresh runner with an unavailable probe, a suppressed
AX issue with a matching candidate, healthy coordinate tap followed by typing,
and failures outside the optional observation scope. These tests must not seed a
snapshot penalty to make the first tap safe.

The recorder consumes optional-read issues before forwarding to XCTest. XCTest's
expected-failure API must not own this scope: in a long-lived command test it can
complete the enclosing test even when the command response succeeds.

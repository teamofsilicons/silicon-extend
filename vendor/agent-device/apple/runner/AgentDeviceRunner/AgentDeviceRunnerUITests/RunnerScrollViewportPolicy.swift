// The scroll viewport rule the runner shares with the TS runtime (#2500).
//
// RULE: a directional scroll centres its swipe, so a focused field puts the swipe's lower endpoint
// under the keyboard — the gesture lands on keys, the surface never moves, and the edge loop reads a
// stuck container (#2499) rather than a refusal. Clipping the viewport to the band above the
// keyboard BEFORE the gesture planner runs keeps the swipe in what is visible, and when that band is
// too thin to hold one the rule REFUSES instead of handing back the full frame: a keyboard-struck
// swipe and a tiny clipped swipe both read as "stuck", so failing open is what hides the failure.
//
// The pure rule below is geometry on purpose — no XCUIApplication — so its exact decision is proven
// against the golden table shared with its TS twin, `clipScrollViewportAboveKeyboard` in
// packages/contracts/src/scroll-gesture.ts, asserted in that file's test and in
// UnitTests/RunnerTests+ScrollViewportPolicyTests.swift. The table carries only frames
// representable in both languages: `CGRect` standardizes a negative extent into a positive height
// at a moved origin, so a negative `height` is tested on the TS side alone.
//
// The `extension RunnerTests` below is the one impure caller: it reads the runner's own live keyboard
// frame, because a frame threaded from the daemon would predate the keyboard.

// boundary, the route policies, and the pure outcome function this wraps. Everything that touches
// the polled field value lives in this one file, which is the surface
// apple-runner-log-redaction.test.ts guards.

  /// condemned both at the same instant — and the throttled case is a working command reported as
  /// `TEXT_INPUT_COMMIT_NOT_OBSERVED`, which is what turned an environment episode into a red
  /// lane on branches touching no iOS code.
  ///
  /// So time is granted against *progress* — the observed value's expected-prefix growing, the
  /// same length-only evidence `logCommitCadence` already emits — with an absolute `ceiling`, so a
  /// pipeline delivering one character per stall window cannot hold a command open forever. A
  /// pipeline making no progress at all still expires at exactly the `stallBudget` the flat
  /// deadline used, so nothing that fails today starts passing merely by waiting longer.
  ///
  /// Started by the poll loop from its own first `now()`, and held as a local `var` there. The
  /// wait's setup reads the field's placeholder first, an AX round-trip that takes seconds on
  /// exactly the loaded host this exists for; charging that to the deadline made the wait give up
  /// sooner than the flat budget it replaced.

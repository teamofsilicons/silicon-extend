# Agent Device Domain Language

Canonical vocabulary for the automation domain. Use these names in code, tests, issues, and
architecture notes; implementation decisions and procedures belong in ADRs and task guidance.

## Language

### Sessions, targets, and devices

**Platform family**:
An internal ownership group for related automation platforms: Apple, Android, HarmonyOS, Vega,
Linux, web.

**Platform leaf**:
A concrete OS and device shape within a platform family, classified independently: iOS simulator,
physical iOS, tvOS, or macOS.

**Platform module**:
A private package owning one platform family's device mechanics, metadata, and runtime bindings.

**Device inventory gateway**:
The platform-neutral composition of local-family and provider inventory sources.

**Device runtime gateway**:
The platform-neutral boundary that reports runtime facts and binds an admitted device to its
runtime owner.

**Runtime owner**:
The one local platform module, managed local owner, or provider runtime selected to execute
behavior for an ownership-qualified device.

**Managed local owner**:
The exact-only runtime owner for an allocator-managed local device; it delegates automation
to the device's platform module while lifecycle stays with the allocator.
_Avoid_: Managed provider, provider runtime

**Request binding**:
A request-lived attachment of cancellation, diagnostics, progress, and admitted context to a
runtime owner.

**Bound device runtime**:
The view returned once a request binding proves the required runtime operations.

**Runtime facet**:
A capability-cohesive interface on a bound device runtime with semantic inputs and typed outcomes.

**Runtime fact**:
A typed claim about behavior available for one exact platform leaf, device or backend, and provider
mode.

**Narrowed bound runtime**:
A projection exposing required facets, optional preferred facets, and no undeclared facets.

**Host capability**:
Narrow authority given to a platform module for host execution, diagnostics, progress, or native
assets.

**Target**:
The selected automation destination, such as mobile, TV, or desktop.

**Session**:
Daemon-owned state for one selected target and its opened app or surface.

**Device key**:
A stable provider-scoped identity for device ownership and contention.

**Device lease**:
Logical remote ownership of a selected device for a tenant, run, or client.

**Lease provider**:
The remote connection source that routes and owns a device lease.

**Runner lease**:
A mutual-exclusion guard for a platform helper process. It is not remote client ownership.
_Avoid_: Device lease, process lease

**Device claim**:
Host-global exclusive ownership of one local device by an open session, a sessionless mutating
command, or an allocator-held claim for a managed identity.

**Allocator-held claim**:
A device claim whose principal is an installation and an allocator identity incarnation rather than
a process; sessions and commands execute under it, and only the allocator's removal proof clears it.
_Avoid_: Stale claim, session claim, synthetic session

**Device-claim policy**:
A command's observation, ownership, or exclusive-mutation rule.

**Device-claim rule**:
The per-owner-kind decision at the claim gate: ordinary, allocator-held, or none.
_Avoid_: Claim policy, device-claim policy

**Managed binding fence**:
The ownership fence of one managed binding: requester and identity incarnation as its token,
request generation as its generation.

**Request generation**:
The per-requester monotonic number of one allocation attempt on a lane; never shared across
requesters.

**Identity incarnation**:
The allocator-issued id of one creation of a managed identity, stable for its pool lifetime
and preserved across Android clean-baseline reuse; a fresh iOS identity is a new device with a
new incarnation, and a different incarnation on a claimed device is a conflict.
_Avoid_: Request generation

**Human-control hold**:
A device-scoped pause on agent mutations during human operation.

### Commands and routing

**Command surface**:
The catalog of public command identity, exposure, adapter policy, and metadata across entrypoints.

**Runtime use**:
A command's platform-neutral declaration of required operations and preferred fast paths.

**Inventory use**:
An inventory command's platform-neutral declaration for composing device sources unbound.

**Daemon command registry**:
The daemon-side truth for route ownership and request-policy traits.

**Runner command traits**:
Per-command classes steering Apple runner lifecycle and recovery, independent of the public surface.

**Runner demand**:
What a Simulator open prepares, or releases unused, of the XCTest runner for remaining steps.

**Daemon RPC protocol version**:
The integer that detects breaking compatibility across the remote daemon boundary.

**Version-skew invariant**:
Local client and daemon versions must match; only remote daemons, separately versioned helpers,
persisted artifacts, and released API consumers get compatibility handling.

### Interactions, selectors, and refs

**Interactor**:
The legacy monolithic interface between dispatch and platform behavior, kept only for unmigrated
commands.
_Avoid_: New or migrated command behavior

**Interaction dispatch path**:
One route an interaction command takes from a resolved target to device execution.

**Coordinate-first resolved element activation**:
An Apple interaction that resolves a semantic element and activates its resolved center point
without a second lookup.

**Parent-owned touch point**:
A point that keeps the selected parent's identity while avoiding independently interactive
descendants at its center.

**Guarantee cell**:
One dispatch-path-by-guarantee classification: enforced, delegated, inapplicable, or waived.

**Owned waiver**:
A guarantee gap with a tracking issue and explicit owner.

**Delegation-on-error**:
A fast path that returns semantic failures to the shared path; it establishes failure-side
handling, not success-path parity.

**Parity table**:
A golden rule table consumed by both TypeScript and native tests.

**Coverage manifest**:
A contract test's declaration of the guarantee cells it proves.

**Ref frame**:
The session's authorization namespace for mutating `@ref` targets: a frozen observation epoch and
issuance scope.

**Frame expiry seam**:
The point just before a mutating device operation where the active ref frame becomes invalid.

**Mutation admission**:
The decision that an active ref frame's epoch and issuance scope authorize a ref mutation.

**Ref generation pin**:
An optional `~s<n>` suffix carrying the snapshot generation an `@ref` was minted from.

**Deferred interaction outcome**:
Post-response state recording whether a mutation still needs outcome retry, stabilization, or
snapshot freshness recovery.

**Settled observation**:
An optional post-action observation that waits for a quiet UI and diffs against the pre-action
tree.

**Resolution disclosure**:
Bounded response evidence describing how an interaction target resolved, issuing no new actionable
refs.

### Gestures and touch

**Gesture plan**:
Typed, platform-neutral normalization of one- or two-contact gesture intent into bounded pointer
trajectories.

**Android planned-touch executor**:
The Android boundary selecting a provider-native or instrumentation-backed executor for a
normalized touch plan.

**Multi-touch geometry**:
The centroid, span, angle, translation, scale, and rotation that construct two-contact motion.

### Snapshots and capture

**Raw AX node**:
A backend-owned accessibility value before snapshot presentation.

**Snapshot acquisition**:
One backend attempt's raw AX nodes and attempt-level capture facts.

**Snapshot producer**:
The acquisition component that produced a snapshot's raw tree; presentation, scope, and geometry
key on the producer, never on the platform channel alone.

**Presentation options**:
The policy input turning one snapshot acquisition into a public projection.

**Snapshot policy facet**:
The host-side owner of neutral snapshot policy (presentation, freshness, timeout, overlay);
platform acquisition supplies raw facts and a fold policy, and runner-side Swift presentation stays
separate across the process boundary.

**Capture hint**:
The acquisition-facing view of a snapshot request: the projection a backend must serve, raw
traversal depth kept apart from regular presented depth, and narrowing only where the backend can
prove it complete.

**Regular presented-depth frontier**:
The acquisition boundary for an unscoped regular snapshot, measured against regular presented depth
after structural wrappers collapse.

**Snapshot eligibility**:
Membership in a presented snapshot projection, independent of current hittability.

**Clip fold**:
The regular projection's single visibility interpreter, run inside presentation for every
backend: viewport and scroll-container clipping, ancestor projection, scroll hints, collapsed
depth. Platform differences enter as a fold policy, never as a backend exception.

**Presented node**:
A wire-facing snapshot value produced at the presentation boundary.

**Snapshot capture plan**:
An ordered set of capture backends under one shared wall-clock budget.

**Snapshot quality verdict**:
A structured statement of capture state, backend, degradation reason, effective depth, and
collapsed content.

**Snapshot projection**:
A view of one acquired tree. Interactive is a subset of regular, and regular is a subset of raw.

**Declared capture residue**:
A fidelity limit in acquired evidence that presentation cannot repair and must disclose.

**AX-unavailable target invalidation**:
The Apple behavior that discards a suspect cached application target after a root AX failure.

### Recording and replay

**Script recording**:
Session mode that captures portable actions and target evidence into a `.ad` script.
_Avoid_: Screen recording

**Recorded input parameterization**:
An explicit fill contract that sends literal text to the live app while storing a caller-chosen
`${VAR}` placeholder durably.

**Open-to-destination script**:
A self-contained `.ad` script that opens an app, reaches and verifies a destination, and leaves the
session active.

**Destination guard**:
A selector-targeted wait near the end of an open-to-destination script verifying its ready state.

**Replay script source bundle**:
The complete caller-resolved set of script paths and contents for one replay or test run.

**Screen-recording facet**:
A runtime facet that starts video capture and returns a live handle and durable descriptor.

**Live resource handle**:
Process-local authority to finish or forcibly dispose active logging, recording, or profiling.

**Durable resource descriptor**:
Bounded, versioned identity and recovery state from which the same runtime owner can reattach.

**Reattachment**:
A fenced recovery attempt by the descriptor's exact runtime owner returning a live handle, completed
result, missing state, or typed refusal.

### Maestro compatibility

**Maestro program**:
A source-preserving typed representation of the supported Maestro Flow syntax and behavior.

**Maestro observation generation**:
Compatibility-engine evidence since the most recent mutation; mutation invalidates it.

### Providers and tests

**Provider**:
An external adapter that owns a device runtime or contributes transport to a platform module.

**Managed device allocator port**:
The daemon-owned interface to a managed-device allocator: obtain, hold, and give back a managed
device.
_Avoid_: Simlock client, lease provider

**Cloud WebDriver runtime**:
A provider runtime mapping a cloud-owned Appium or WebDriver session into agent-device inventory,
leases, runtime behavior, artifacts, and release.

**Cloud artifact**:
Provider-hosted session output: video, automation logs, device logs, or dashboard links.

**Daemon artifact type**:
An optional semantic category from the owner of a daemon-managed downloadable artifact.

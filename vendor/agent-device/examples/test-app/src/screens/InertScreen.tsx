/**
 * A surface on which a tap provably changes nothing.
 *
 * `retryTapIfNoChange` only re-taps when the post-tap snapshot signature equals
 * the pre-tap one, and that signature hashes EVERY node on screen — not just the
 * tapped subtree. So any live content anywhere on the screen suppresses the
 * retry, which is what made the layer-3 tap-retry scenario a coin flip on the
 * home screen (its gesture lab loads a remote image whose arrival lands on either
 * side of the tap). See https://github.com/callstack/agent-device/issues/1300.
 *
 * Everything here is therefore deliberately constrained, and each rule is load-
 * bearing for that scenario rather than stylistic:
 *
 * - no state, effects, timers, or async work — nothing to arrive after capture
 * - no images (a remote one loads whenever the network says so)
 * - no ScrollView — scroll offset moves node bounds, which are part of the hash
 * - nothing pressable, so a tap cannot mutate the screen even by accident
 *
 * Adding any of those back re-opens #1300. Put dynamic fixtures on another
 * screen; this one exists to hold still.

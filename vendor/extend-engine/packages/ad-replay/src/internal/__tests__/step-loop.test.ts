 * trip, including the `--keep-session` live-session postcondition) live in
 * `src/daemon/replay/internal/__tests__/session-replay-runtime-keep-session.test.ts`
 * (renamed from `session-replay-terminal-lifecycle.test.ts` by the #1555
 * structural-quality review — see that file's own header for the rationale);
 * this file covers the SAME suppression decision at the cheaper,

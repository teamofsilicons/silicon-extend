/**
 * #1478 P5 stage C2a: the target-verification ENGINE policy — moved verbatim
 * out of `src/daemon/replay/internal/session-replay-target-verification.ts`, which
 * keeps the DAEMON-AUTHORITY half (capture, `SessionStore`, resume stamping,
 * wire projection into `DaemonResponse`). This module decides, over already-
 * available plain values, whether/how a recorded target-binding annotation
 * should be verified — never itself touching a snapshot capture, a session,
 * or a wire response.
 *
 * #1555 review R3 ("target verification must happen INSIDE the engine"): the
 * four functions below are called ONLY from `./step-loop.ts`'s
 * `verifyAndDispatchStep` — the engine's own step loop, never the daemon —
 * and are NOT re-exported by the package façade (`../index.ts`). The daemon
 * (`session-replay-target-verification.ts`) now implements only the narrow
 * `AdReplayStepRuntime` capabilities `verifyAndDispatchStep` drives (routing,
 * capture, classification, dispatch, wire-building); it never imports this
 * module.
 *
 * Two pure decisions live here:
 *
 *  - `planPostResolutionTargetVerification` / `planPreDispatchTargetVerification`:
 *    should the step loop even attempt verification, and with what token —
 *    mirrors the two branches of the pre-#1555-R3 daemon orchestrator's
 *    original pre-capture gating exactly (#1349's deferred-landmark `wait`
 *    case, and the ordinary pre-dispatch token/parse gate).
 *  - `deriveReplayTargetGuardMismatchEvidence` / `deriveWaitLandmarkMismatchEvidence`:
 *    given the recorded evidence and a post-dispatch refusal's TYPED evidence
 *    (`AdReplayGuardMismatchEvidence`/`AdReplayLandmarkMismatchEvidence`),
 *    compute the observed identity and mismatch lines a target-binding
 *    divergence reports — the daemon then wraps the result into a
 *    `DaemonResponse`.
 *
 * #1555 review P1 (second pass, "translate wire failures before the engine
 * boundary"): the two derive functions used to take the wire response's raw
 * `details: Record<string, unknown> | undefined` bag directly — a daemon
 * wire shape crossing into the engine despite carrying no `DaemonResponse`
 * itself. The daemon adapter (`session-replay-runtime-engine-adapter.ts`)
 * now narrows that bag into the typed `AdReplayGuardMismatchEvidence`/
 * `AdReplayLandmarkMismatchEvidence` shapes below BEFORE constructing the
 * `AdReplayDispatchOutcome` the engine sees — the `unknown`-parsing readers
 * that used to live here (`readGuardMismatchObservedIdentity`,
 * `readAncestryEntries`, an anonymous structural-denotation reader) moved
 * there with it, since reading an untyped wire bag is wire-projection work,
 * not engine policy. This module now only reads already-typed values.

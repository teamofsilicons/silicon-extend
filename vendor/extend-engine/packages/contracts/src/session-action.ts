// One recorded action in a session's script.

// `replay/` reads and writes these and the Maestro package exports them, so declaring the
// shape inside the daemon's own session record made both zones depend on the daemon server to
// describe a file
// format neither of them asks the daemon to produce. The daemon still owns the RECORDING — it is
// the only thing that appends actions; this is only the shape they are appended in.
//
// It could not move until `CommandFlags` did, since a recorded action carries the flags it ran
// with: this was the tail of a three-link chain (DaemonBatchStep -> CommandFlags -> SessionAction).

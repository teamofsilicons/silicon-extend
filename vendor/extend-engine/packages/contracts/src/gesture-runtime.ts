 * requirement it can actually meet, and a command requires exactly the tier its input selected,
 * so a device is refused where the retired `requireGestureSupported` refused it instead of
 * failing mid-execution.
 *
 * The tiers, and the retired admission each one restates:
 * - `performGesturePlan` — one-contact fling/pan, and every `swipe`. Refused where the legacy
 *   check refused a plain gesture (web, watchOS, visionOS).
 * - `performDirectionalFlingPlan` — `gesture fling --direction`, whose speed semantics Linux
 *   cannot honor even though it executes coordinate flings through its drag primitive.
 * - `performMultiTouchGesturePlan` — pinch/rotate/transform and two-pointer pan. On Apple this is
 *   the two-finger XCTest synthesis, which is iOS/iPadOS **simulator** only.
 * - `performTargetAuthoredDrag` — `gesture drag`, which needs an adapter preserving source hold,
 *   timed movement, and destination hold.

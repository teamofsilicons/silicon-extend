/**
 * The interaction guarantee matrix (ADR 0011).
 *
 * Every dispatch path an interaction command can take must classify EVERY
 * guarantee: enforced by shared runtime code, enforced runner-side (with a
 * parity table once ADR 0011 phase 3 lands), delegated to another path,
 * inapplicable by construction, or explicitly waived with a reason.
 *
 * This registry plus its gate test is an HONESTY/COMPLETENESS gate, not a
 * truth gate: it proves every path has declared a stance and that referenced
 * symbols exist. Behavioral parity is only proven once the golden fixture
 * tables (Layer 2) and contract scenarios (Layer 3) land.
 *
 * The `Record` over the guarantee union makes completeness a compile error:
 * adding a guarantee refuses to build until every path classifies it, and a
 * new path cannot omit a cell. The companion gate test keeps the entries
 * honest (referenced symbols must exist, waivers must carry reasons, and
 * every `gap:` waiver must carry a tracking issue).
 *
 * Closure strategy for the acknowledged gaps is hybrid (see ADR 0011):
 * runner-side parity for cheap geometry-local rules; delegation-on-error for
 * semantic/rich-runtime failures (which is NOT success-path parity — cells
 * where the fast path can succeed on a candidate the runtime rules would
 * refuse stay gaps until proven); and a shared runtime preflight against the
 * already-captured snapshot node for the native-ref path, because a backend
 * fast path can silently succeed and delegation-on-error never triggers
 * (implemented: preflightNativeRefInteraction, #1081).

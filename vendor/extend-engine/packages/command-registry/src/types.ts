 *                           envelope is exactly `envelopeMs`.

 *                           REPLACES the envelope (replay semantics: --timeout
 *                           bounds the request). With `envelope: 'widen'` it only
 *                           ever EXTENDS the envelope to envelopeMs + budget +
 *                           margin (interaction --settle semantics, #1101: the

 *                           flag is omitted.
 *  - `'positional-parser'`— the budget travels inside the positionals; `parser`
 *                           extracts it (or returns null when none was given).
 *                           The client widens the envelope to

 *                   which reaches the daemon through the `install_source` internal command.
 *  - `batchable`  — whether the command is exposed through `batch`, projected into
 *                   STRUCTURED_BATCH_COMMAND_NAMES (#909).
 *  - `mcpExposed` — whether the command is surfaced over MCP, in place of the
 *                   hand-maintained exclusion list (`8ef4e73408` #1137).
 *  - `timeoutPolicy` — the request-envelope budget source + on-timeout daemon policy,
 *                   in place of the daemon client's timeout lists (`b25ef7b024` #1084).
 *                   REQUIRED on every entry — most commands share the

 *                   command must say so rather than inherit silently.
 * The remaining facets are plain declarations their consumers derive from:
 *  - `postActionObservation` — optional interaction observation trait for
 *                   commands that support `--settle`/`--verify`; consumed by
 *                   command surfaces and timeout policy instead of repeated
 *                   command-name lists.
 *  - `responseDataTransform` — optional public response data shaping rules for
 *                   command-owned fields in daemon responses. This keeps
 *                   response shaping on the same descriptor surface as other
 *                   command traits.
 *  - `catalog` — command identity projection metadata. Every descriptor
 *                   declares its catalog group explicitly.
 *  - `frameworkTier` — which default tool set a framework adapter includes a
 *                   public command in (see {@link CommandFrameworkTier}).

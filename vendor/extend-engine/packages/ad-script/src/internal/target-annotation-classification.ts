/**
 * ADR 0012 decision 3: the record/replay-shared CLASSIFICATION core over
 * versioned `.ad` target-binding evidence — `classifyTargetBindingMatch`'s
 * replay-time verification paths 2-6. Inert in migration step 3: nothing
 * enforces parsed evidence at replay time until step 4.
 *
 * #1555 review P1 ("complete the binding façade instead of documenting
 * deviations"): this used to live in `@agent-device/ad-replay`'s
 * `target-identity.ts`, reasoning that it was engine-owned policy rather
 * than script vocabulary. In practice its only real consumers were the
 * daemon's RECORD-time self-check (`@agent-device/selectors/target-evidence`)
 * and its REPLAY-time classification wrapper
 * (`src/daemon/replay/internal/session-replay-target-classification.ts`) — both
 * daemon files, neither reachable through `inspectAdReplay`/`runAdReplay`.
 * It interprets `TargetAnnotationV1` evidence semantics shared beyond the
 * engine (record-time AND replay-time both need the SAME verdict by
 * construction), so it belongs alongside the rest of that shared `.ad`
 * target-binding vocabulary in this package rather than behind a façade
 * only one of its two callers could reach.

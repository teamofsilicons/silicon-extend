/**
 * One `runner.log` serves every command sent to one device and is never truncated between them
 * (#2683). Classifying a failure from the tail of that file therefore reads whatever the last
 * crashed command left behind and hands the blame to whoever failed next — a `snapshot` that timed
 * out two commands after an app crash used to be reported as that crash.
 *
 * The marker under test is where the log had reached when the command was sent, so only bytes this
 * command wrote can explain it.

 * supplies is the window it allows and the session's target; everything else is this family's.
 *

 * runner as `ALERT_NOT_FOUND`, the macOS helper as `reason: 'alert-not-found'`. Nothing here reads
 * an error message: a transport, runner or helper failure that happened to mention an alert would
 * otherwise be retried until the window expired and then reported as a timeout, hiding the cause.

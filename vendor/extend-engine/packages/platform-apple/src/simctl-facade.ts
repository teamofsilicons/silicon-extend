/**
 * Builds the `simctl io recordVideo` argv for one Apple simulator, naming the panel the device
 * currently lights.
 *
 * A foldable lights one panel at a time and simctl's implicit display default is the highest screen
 * ID — the dark panel — so a recording that omits `--display` captures black while exiting 0. The
 * panel decision belongs to the Apple package, which owns the display inventory.
 *
 * The inventory is imported per call, not statically: this façade keeps its eager closure at the
 * simctl argv builder, and recording is not a startup path.

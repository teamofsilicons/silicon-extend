 * vocabulary and the tool.
 *
 * Both halves are confined to the iPhone/iPad simulator leaf. The daemon refuses a leaf outside it
 * before it binds anything, so this guard is what an owner still enforces on its own when it is
 * reached directly: the content-size surface was only ever verified on that leaf, and a write that
 * reached an Apple TV or Vision Pro simulator would be reported as applied on a device whose setting
 * may not exist. The leaf rule and the refusal are declared once — `isHandheldAppleSimulator` and
 * `APPLE_TEXT_SIZE_LEAF_REFUSAL` — and the runtime's read fact reads the same predicate.

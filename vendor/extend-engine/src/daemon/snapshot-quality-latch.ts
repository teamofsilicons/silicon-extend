 * One-shot warning latch for penalty-deferred captures (PR #1587 follow-up).
 *
 * `renderSnapshotQualityWarnings` suppresses the full recovered warning for
 * `reasonCode: 'deferred'` on the assumption that the capture which ARMED the
 * XCTest-channel penalty already rendered it. Internal captures (selector
 * resolution, settle observation loops, system-modal probes) can arm the
 * penalty without any user-facing render, and the runner cannot tell the two
 * apart — so the daemon tracks per session whether a recovered warning actually
 * reached this client for the currently penalized app, and re-renders it once
 * when it has not.
 *
 * Transitions (evaluated only on user-facing snapshot/diff responses):
 * - genuine `recovered` — the same response already carries the full warning
 *   (rendered by the runtime), so the latch is set without injecting anything;
 * - `deferred` with the latch not held for this app — inject the full warning
 *   once and set the latch;
 * - `healthy` — the penalty window is over; clear the latch so the next arming
 *   renders again;
 * - `sparse` or no verdict — no penalty signal either way; latch unchanged.
 *
 * The daemon cannot observe penalty arming directly (a 120s TTL held
 * runner-side), so "penalty window" is approximated by the verdicts of public
 * captures: as long as no public capture reports healthy, an unbroken hostile
 * stretch of the same app warns once.

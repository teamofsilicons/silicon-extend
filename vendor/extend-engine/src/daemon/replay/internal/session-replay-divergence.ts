 * tree — a divergence STALER or NARROWER than `snapshot`, which is exactly the
 * invariant this amendment forbids: an agent must never see a healthier
 * `screen` in a divergence report than a plain `snapshot` would show it.
 *
 * The capture flags are a CLEAN, fixed divergence-capture policy, NOT the
 * failed action's flags: `snapshotRaw`/`snapshotScope`/`snapshotDepth` from a

 * full for non-rect `get`/`is`/`wait` reads so static-text targets survive,
 * interactive otherwise), matching heal's long-standing rule. The chrome filter
 * (`collectSettleChromeRefs`) and the meaningful-target filter stay layered ON
 * TOP of this full capture as FILTERS, never as a narrower scoping.

/**
 * A `replay` request shaped the way the CLI actually sends one: #1802 made the
 * CALLER read every script file the run needs, so a request whose first
 * positional names a script also carries that script's source bundle. Tests
 * pass `positionals: [filePath]` as before and the bundle is built from the
 * same file, exactly as `replayDaemonWriter` builds it.
 *
 * The bundle carries the ENTRY FILE only, which is the whole of a native `.ad`
 * script and enough for a self-contained flow. A Maestro fixture with `runFlow`
 * includes must pass its own `flags.replayScriptSource` from
 * `maestroScriptSourceBundleFor` — collecting includes needs the engine, which
 * loads on demand and so cannot happen in a synchronous fixture.

 * the authoring lifecycle and the target path), so ANY recordable command that reaches
 * a handler with the raw flag set can arm publication and later write a `.ad`
 * artifact — `record stop` writes one immediately through record-only cleanup,
 * `trace` and the interaction commands publish later on close.
 *
 * The CLI/Node/MCP surfaces only ever emit the flag for its released owners, so
 * the arming path is reachable only by a hand-built wire request. This closes
 * it at the daemon request seam — the single entry point BOTH the socket and
 * HTTP transports funnel through (`createRequestHandler`), and ahead of
 * admission, session lookup, device resolution, and handler dispatch — so an
 * unsupported request can neither arm publication nor perform any device work.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the request is allowed through: no flag at all
 * (including the flag absent from a request that never had it), or a released
 * owner command. Presence is what is rejected, not truthiness — a raw
 * `saveScript: false` is just as unsupported on `record` as `true` is, and
 * mirrors the maestro replay guard's `!== undefined` reading of the same flag.

/**
 * `--settle` on the generic daemon route (#1638): `scroll` and `back` change
 * the screen without resolving an element, so they never reach the interaction
 * handler that owns the touch commands' settle wiring — but scroll-then-observe
 * and back-then-observe are exactly the pairs an agent wants collapsed into one
 * call. This module is the generic route's half of that contract.
 *
 * It is reached through a LAZY SEAM (`await import`) from
 * request-generic-dispatch, and hands back a CLOSURE rather than a plan object,
 * so that dispatcher needs no static edge here — not even a type-only one. That
 * is not incidental: observing a settled screen runs the interaction runtime, a
 * subgraph the generic dispatcher otherwise never touches, and a static edge
 * folds all ~18 of its files into the daemon-server type cycle (R10 caught
 * exactly that). An ordinary scroll/back pays neither the import nor the
 * comprehension cost.
 *
 * Two seams, and the order between them is load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. {@link planGenericSettleObservation} runs BEFORE the command dispatches and
 *    freezes the diff baseline. The baseline is the session's STORED pre-action
 *    tree, so the diff reads "settled tree vs the last tree you observed" — it
 *    may be several commands old, unlike press's freshly resolved pre-action
 *    capture. That is the honest #1101 contract for a route with no resolution
 *    step, and the settle loop's own captures overwrite `session.snapshot`, so
 *    reading it afterwards would compare the settled tree against itself.
 * 2. The returned observer runs AFTER the command AND after
 *    `markDeferredInteractionOutcome`. Marking first is what lets settle's very
 *    first capture fold in the #1542 post-gesture stabilization instead of
 *    racing it — every capture on this path goes through the same deferred
 *    outcome resolution a plain snapshot would.

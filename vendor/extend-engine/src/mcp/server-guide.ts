 * truncates it at 2 KB, so it holds only what changes the first few calls: start with

 * error hints. Everything situational lives behind the `help` tool.

export const MCP_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `agent-device drives iOS, Android, tvOS, Android TV, macOS, Linux, and web apps. Tools mirror CLI commands of the same name; CLI flags are camelCase properties (--settle -> settle: true).

Start: known app -> call open {app, foreground: true} at once; do not probe with devices, apps, appstate, snapshot, or screenshot first. open returns the initial interactive snapshot with @refs. Unknown app id: devices, then apps, then open the discovered id; never invent ids. Existing session: continue from its state, do not reopen.

Loop: press/click/fill/longpress/hover/scroll/back with settle: true; the response is the settled UI diff, continue from it. To reach an off-screen target, scroll {direction, until: "<selector>"} scrolls until it is on screen in one call, and direction "bottom" runs to the end of the content; repeated bare scrolls are the slow way to find something. snapshot {interactiveOnly: true} only when the diff lacks the next target or did not settle. Verify with wait {kind: "text", text}, wait {selector}, wait {absent: selector}, is, get, or find; a bare screenshot is not verification. End with close.

Targets: copy refs byte-for-byte (@e12, @e12~s4; keep @ and any ~sN). Refs go stale after mutations. Prefer refs, then id/label/role selectors; coordinates last. On a sparse/AX-unavailable warning its refs and selectors are invalid: screenshot, read the image, press {x, y}, then snapshot the changed screen.

Errors carry hints; follow them instead of re-planning. Call help only for specialized work (gestures, scripting, TV, macOS, web, remote, debugging) or an unclear command shape, never at startup.`;

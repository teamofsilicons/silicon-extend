 * install and not on edit, and every install of one published version is the same
 * artifact, so the version is the whole of the identity it can offer: `size:mtime`
 * cannot be a fingerprint of it, because an installer stamps a fresh mtime on every
 * file and two installs of identical bytes would then sign differently and replace
 * each other's daemon — live session with it (#2458). A source checkout is the tree

 * counted — costs tens of milliseconds and goes through the stat-validated cache
 * (`code-signature-cache.ts`), which replays the identical signature from `statSync`
 * alone. That cache loads on demand, which is why this is async: only the checkout arm
 * can reach it, and a static import would put it and its atomic-publish dependency in
 * the startup closure of every client that cannot use it (`eager-closure-budgets.ts`).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT memoized, unlike the launch spec above: a long-lived client (the
 * MCP server) must still notice a daemon rebuilt underneath it, and the cache is what
 * makes re-answering that question per request cheap.

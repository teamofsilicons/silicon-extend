 * `process.exit()` truncates output still queued on `process.stdout`/`stderr`:
 * Node writes to those streams synchronously only when they're a file or TTY —
 * when the CLI runs as a piped subprocess (the common case for an agent
 * driving it), writes are queued asynchronously, and `process.exit()` tears
 * the process down before a queued write reaches the pipe. A caller then sees
 * a truncated or empty final message instead of the structured error.
 * `FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds the wait so a stalled/broken pipe still exits
 * rather than hanging the process.

 * name. A few CLI routes additionally inject a *different* command into their flow —
 * `react-devtools start` on a Limrun Android instance sets up its port reverse by
 * dispatching internal `runtime`. That injection is the case where a descriptor's own
 * module is platform-free while its route reaches platform behavior, so the pairs must
 * be enumerable to keep the migration denominator honest.
 *
 * This table is that enumeration, and {@link sendInjectedDaemonRequest} is the only way
 * to perform one: the route and command are typed parameters checked against this table,
 * so an undeclared pair is a compile error rather than something a scanner must find.

 * Catches: a core or daemon module reaching up into commands/ — the one direction the ranked
 *   spine (R5/R6) cannot see on its own, because "commands is above core" is a zone-table fact,
 *   not a rank the cycle/back-edge checkers infer.
 * Evidence: ba1a5efbc6 (#1449) introduced the policy table after R1-R3 lived as hand-written
 *   predicates; 2e0879a260 (#987) records the SDK-barrel exemption R3 needed before retirement.
 * Cost: 152 LOC (72 rule + 80 test).
 * Kill criterion: none enforced today; retire only by maintainer decision that "core and daemon
 *   never import commands/" no longer matters — moot only if commands/ absorbs core and daemon
 *   as internal implementation detail and the zone table collapses to one row or fewer.

 *
 * The evaluator is deliberately small. Everything a policy can say is in `ZonePolicy`, so a rule
 * that needs more than these fields does NOT belong here: R4 (cycles), R5/R6 (spine ranking),
 * R7 (field ownership) and R9 (cycle size) are whole-graph or non-import properties, and each
 * keeps its own checker.

 * (#2543: commands may not import the schema layer that renders its facets), but #2679 folded
 * `cli-schema` into `commands/schema/`, putting both sides of that direction in the same zone —
 * a same-zone edge this table can never see, since `checkLayeringRules` only evaluates edges
 * that cross zones. `commands-schema-boundary.ts` enforces that direction now, as a
 * folder-scoped rule instead of a zone-policy row.

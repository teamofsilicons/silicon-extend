// Layering scans read tracked repository paths only. Most rules consume production TypeScript;
// the retired zones also consume every tracked path under their former roots so non-TS fixtures
// cannot bypass the ownership boundary.
//
// A leaf module on purpose. `check.ts` owns the scan and imports `package-boundaries.ts`, so the
// boundary rules cannot import `check.ts` back for its file list; without a shared leaf the two
// would each grow their own enumerator, and the moment those disagree a rule silently changes
// scope. That is not hypothetical -- it is the #1965 review finding this module exists to fix:
// `facadeEntryFiles` was briefly implemented as a raw `readdir` walk, which quietly widened R11
// from tracked files to whatever happened to be on disk.
//
// Tracked-only is a hard rule, not an optimization. A layering gate describes COMMITTED state:
// `docs/adr/0019-request-bound-platform-runtime.md` requires review "from a clean committed tree
// with all production files present in HEAD", and `check.ts` separately fails closed when
// production TypeScript is untracked. A scratch file a contributor has not committed -- a
// throwaway `facades/experiment.ts`, a half-finished module -- must be invisible here, or a gate
// that is supposed to describe the repository starts failing on the contents of someone's working
// directory instead.

import { execFileSync } from 'node:child_process';

// `src/**/*.ts` only matches NESTED files, so root-level `src/*.ts` (src/cli.ts,
// src/backend.ts) needs its own pathspec or it silently drops out of every scan.
// Workspace package sources are production files too (#1490 W0).

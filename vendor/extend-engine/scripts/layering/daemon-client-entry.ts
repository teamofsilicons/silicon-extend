// internals: the process root composition is. Every on-disk or protocol contract the client shares
// with the daemon (state-dir/transport resolution, pidfile liveness, the repair tombstone, the
// progress framing) therefore lives at the process root, not under `src/daemon/`, and the client
// reaches it there. What remains is the client reading the daemon's request/response vocabulary —
// the `DaemonRequest`/`DaemonResponse` types that anchor the ADR 0006 wire surface — recorded here,
// per measured `file -> target` edge, and only as a type-only import. A runtime (value or dynamic)
// import of a
// daemon module by the client is always a violation, an undeclared type import is a violation, and
// a recorded edge that no longer exists is stale; all three fail, so the set cannot grow, and a
// repair cannot leave a stale entry that would let the edge back in unnoticed.

 *   and `request-progress-protocol.ts`. The mirror failure — a recorded edge whose import is gone —
 *   is caught too, so a repair cannot leave the door open.
 * Evidence: #2559 measured 13 client→daemon pairs (8 runtime) at the #2557 tip; the runtime half is
 *   now 0 and the 5 wire-only type edges are the residue recorded above.
 * Cost: one rule registered in check.ts's whole-graph pass; not a standalone CI job.
 * Kill criterion: the client reaches the daemon only through its network protocol (the inventory
 *   empty), or a maintainer decision that the client may compose daemon internals directly.

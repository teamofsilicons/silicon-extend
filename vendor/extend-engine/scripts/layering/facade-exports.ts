// Named-export enumeration for a façade module's own source text — the R11
// structural gate in `package-boundaries.test.ts` uses this to prove a
// façade names its exports explicitly instead of a bare `export *`.
//
// Split out of `package-boundaries.ts` (#1574 review): the boundary rules
// answer "may this file import that one?", while this module answers "what
// does this façade name?" — different questions, so per AGENTS.md they are
// different bounded reads.
//
// This module used to also carry `readFacadeExports`, a ~200-line star-chain
// resolver (`GetExportedNames`/`ResolveExport` re-implemented over relative
// specifiers) that existed only to enumerate what a barrel's `export *`
// hides, feeding a hand-maintained 816-symbol pin table
// (`facade-symbols.ts`, #1574). Every workspace-package façade now names its
// exports explicitly (`export { a, b } from './x.ts'`), so there is nothing
// left for a star-chain walker to resolve — the façade file itself is the
// pin, and `readNamedExports` below is enough to prove it stays that way.

/**
 * Every name a façade module exports, value or type-only, sorted — the exact
 * "named-export-list" a package-boundaries gate can pin (#1555 review P1,
 * "add the reviewer-required exact exported-symbol gate"). Covers both
 * re-export forms (`export { a, b } from './x.ts'`,
 * `export type { a, b } from './x.ts'`, with or without `as` aliasing — the
 * alias is reported, since that is the name a consumer actually imports),
 * `export * as ns from './x.ts'` (one real name, `ns`), and direct
 * declarations (`export function`/`const`/`class`/`type`/`interface`,
 * including `export const a = 1, b = 2`'s multiple declarators). A stray
 * export — intentional or not — changes this list, so a test that pins it
 * exactly turns "the façade grew a symbol" into a loud failure instead of a
 * silent widening only a PR diff review would catch.
 *
 * AST-based (`oxc-parser`, already a devDependency — `session-state.ts` is
 * the existing precedent for using it in this gate), not a regex, for the
 * SAME reason `session-state.ts` gives: a regex has to enumerate every
 * export FORM by hand, and the one it forgets is exactly the one that slips
 * through. That is precisely what happened here (#1555 review, second pass,
 * "the gate also ignores export-star declarations, so it can miss future
 * widening"): `export * from './x.ts'` re-exports an unbounded, statically
 * unknowable set of names — the old regex scanner had no case for it at all,
 * so it silently contributed NOTHING to the list instead of failing loudly.
 * `parsed.module.staticExports` is oxc's own resolved export-entry table
 * (built for exactly this purpose, not re-derived from a manual AST walk),
 * and its `exportName.kind` already draws the line this function needs:
 * `'None'` is bare `export *` (unenumerable — thrown), `'Default'` is
 * `export default …` (also thrown — a facade pinned to an exact named-export
 * list must not carry one), and `'Name'` is every enumerable form above,
 * `export * as ns` included (oxc reports its one real bound name, `ns`).

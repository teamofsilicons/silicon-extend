// Catches: a daemon module writing a SessionState field it does not own — aliasing through
//   SessionStore.get()/set() lets any module mutate store-owned state, and only a full-graph
//   AST walk over every assignment site (not a review of one module) can tell whose write
//   it was.
// Evidence: PR #1392 (e8b779cb32) fixed a close-time script-save failure leaking the session/
//   device claim — a symptom of unowned SessionState writes; the field-owner table this file
//   enforces is the durable fix.
// Cost: 262 LOC (no dedicated test file; exercised through daemon-modularity.test.ts and
//   model.test.ts).
// Kill criterion: none enforced today; retire only by maintainer decision that per-field
//   SessionState write ownership no longer matters. SessionStore hands out the live record
//   through get()/set(), so a `session.<field> =` from any module type-checks; no owner exists
//   at the type level.
//
// R7 session-state ownership.
//
// `SessionStore.get()` hands back the live `SessionState` out of a private Map, and `set()`
// re-puts the same reference — so a `session.<field> = …` anywhere in the daemon is a durable
// write to store-owned state, and whether it persists depends on aliasing rather than on an
// API call. That is workable while each field has an owner that keeps its invariants; it stops
// being workable the moment a field's rule is spread across modules, because nothing at the
// store boundary can check it.
//
// So the ownership is written down here and enforced. The table is not an aspiration: it is
// the set of writers that exist, so the gate's job is to stop the set from growing quietly.
// Adding a field to `SessionState` forces a deliberate owner; writing an existing field from
// a new module fails until that module is either declared an owner or, better, calls the
// owner instead. ADR 0014's ref frame is the worked example, and the one that has since been
// taken further than this table can go: its four fields moved together across two modules
// until `activateRefFrame` took the transition, and they are now a single value whose nominal
// type no other module can construct, edit, or derive from an existing frame.
//
// Detection is AST-based (`oxc-parser`, already a devDependency) rather than a line regex. A
// regex has to enumerate assignment operators, and the ones it forgets are exactly the ones
// that slip through: `??=` on an optional field is the natural way to write a default, and a
// computed `session[key] =` hides the field name entirely. The parser reports every
// assignment and update form for free, and a `session.a.b = …` sub-object write is reported
// as what it is rather than mistaken for a write to `a`.

/**
 * Daemon RPC wire-surface gate, released-baseline half (#1432).
 *
 * The unit lane (`test/wire-compat/wire-compat.test.ts`) proves the ledger
 * matches the source it describes. It cannot prove the thing ADR 0006 actually
 * requires — that a wire change since the last RELEASED version came with a
 * protocol bump — because from a single commit a bumped ledger and an unbumped
 * one are both just an edited file.
 *
 * So this reads the ledger as it stood at the last released tag and hands both
 * to `model.ts`. Baseline is the released tag, never arbitrary git history: an
 * unreleased shape has no peer in the wild to be incompatible with (AGENTS.md,
 * "Unreleased API surface dies free"), so mid-branch churn is free and only the
 * net change since publication has to be justified.
 *
 * Needs full history and tags, so it runs in its own fetch-depth: 0 CI job
 * rather than inside the shallow-clone-safe unit lane — the same split the
 * replay-compat corpus provenance verifier uses.

// Seeded concurrency torture lane for session / lease / lock invariants (#1416,
// umbrella #1412 Track A).
//
// N concurrent clients drive randomized-but-SEEDED interleavings of
// open / mutate / close / takeover / kill against fake providers (the real
// `SessionStore` + `LeaseRegistry`, an in-memory device-claim model), with ALL
// concurrency routed through a deterministic scheduler so a seed fully
// determines execution order. Each operation's lock plan is derived from the
// production router primitive `resolveRequestExecutionLockPlan`, so reverting
// the router's same-device serialization trips the overlap invariant. After
// every run the harness asserts:
//   - no leaked leases or claims,
//   - no cross-session state bleed,
//   - every lock released after owner death,
//   - the session store stays consistent,
//   - same-device critical sections never overlap.
//
// Seed replay (documented in docs/agents/testing.md):
//   TORTURE_SEED=1234 pnpm test:concurrency-torture
// replays that exact interleaving deterministically — the whole scheduler trace,
// not just its length, is asserted equal. Otherwise the lane sweeps TORTURE_RUNS
// seeds (default 128, ≥100 to satisfy the acceptance bar) starting at
// TORTURE_SEED_START (default 0). Any failure prints the seed and replay command.

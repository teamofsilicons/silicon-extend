# Android Snapshot Helper

Small instrumentation APK used to capture Android accessibility snapshots without relying on
`uiautomator dump`'s fixed idle wait behavior. The helper enables Android's interactive-window
retrieval flag and serializes every accessible window root returned by `UiAutomation.getWindows()`
so keyboards and system overlays can appear in the same snapshot. If interactive window roots are
unavailable, it falls back to the active-window root.

The helper is intentionally provider-neutral. Local `adb`, cloud ADB tunnels, and remote device
providers can all install and run the same APK as long as they can execute ADB-style operations.
Released helper APKs use the committed `debug.keystore`; do not rotate it casually, because Android
requires a stable signing certificate for `adb install -r` upgrades.

## Build

```sh
VERSION="$(node -p 'require("./package.json").version')"
AGENT_DEVICE_ANDROID_HELPER=snapshot sh ./scripts/build-android-helper.sh "$VERSION" .tmp/android-snapshot-helper
```

The build uses Android SDK command-line tools directly. It expects `ANDROID_HOME` or
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` to point at an SDK with `platforms/android-36`, and it compiles with the
build-tools version named by `AGENT_DEVICE_ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS` (or the script's last positional).
CI must name that version; a local build without it uses the newest version under `build-tools`
and says so on stderr.
`pnpm prepack` builds the npm-bundled helper into `android/snapshot-helper/dist`; npm users get
that APK in the package and the first helper-backed `snapshot` installs it automatically when
missing or outdated.

## Run

```sh
VERSION="$(node -p 'require("./package.json").version')"
adb install -r ".tmp/android-snapshot-helper/agent-device-android-snapshot-helper-$VERSION.apk"
adb shell am instrument -w \
  -e waitForIdleTimeoutMs 500 \
  -e waitForIdleQuietMs 100 \
  -e timeoutMs 8000 \
  -e maxDepth 128 \
  -e maxNodes 5000 \
  com.callstack.agentdevice.snapshothelper/.SnapshotInstrumentation
```

`maxDepth` also caps recursive traversal depth inside the helper.
The helper is a plain (non-`testOnly`) instrumentation APK, so it installs without `adb install -t`.
Some OEM builds reject `testOnly` packages from adb outright (ColorOS reports a "PC install attack"),
which is why the helper does not set that flag.

`waitForIdleTimeoutMs` defaults to `500`, which is a maximum wait, not a fixed sleep. Direct helper
invocations can pass `0` when immediate capture during ongoing animation is preferred. Root
acquisition has a separate 500 ms stabilization bound that is used only when no root is available or
an active/focused window is temporarily missing its root; complete captures pay no additional wait.

## One-Shot Modes

Passing `-e mode snapshot|viewport|gesture` selects what a single instrumentation run does; `snapshot`
is the default and matches the `Run` section above.

```sh
# Read the interactive-window viewport without capturing a snapshot.
adb shell am instrument -w -e mode viewport \
  com.callstack.agentdevice.snapshothelper/.SnapshotInstrumentation

# Inject a planned touch gesture, described by a base64 JSON payload.
adb shell am instrument -w -e mode gesture -e payloadBase64 "$PAYLOAD" \
  com.callstack.agentdevice.snapshothelper/.SnapshotInstrumentation
```

The `gesture` payload is a base64-encoded JSON object using protocol `android-touch-plan-v1`:

- `kind`: `swipe` (one pointer) or `transform` (two pointers, e.g. pinch/rotate)
- `durationMs`: integer, `0`-`120000`
- `pointers`: array of `{ pointerId, samples }`, `pointerId`s ordered from `0`, one pointer for
  `swipe` and exactly two for `transform`
- each pointer's `samples` is `{ offsetMs, x, y }[]` with at least two entries; `offsetMs` values
  must be strictly increasing (equal offsets are only allowed when `durationMs` is `0`), the first
  sample's `offsetMs` must be `0`, and the last must equal `durationMs`. For `transform` gestures,
  both pointers must share the same `offsetMs` sequence.

## Persistent Session

Passing `-e sessionPort <port>` keeps the instrumentation alive after startup and serves repeated
commands over a local TCP server on `127.0.0.1:<port>`, instead of exiting after one snapshot. This
avoids paying UiAutomation connect/teardown cost per call. Each command uses one short-lived
connection: the client connects, sends a single command line, reads the response, and the server
closes that connection; the process stays alive for the next connection:

- `snapshot <requestId>` — capture and return an XML snapshot, same semantics as the default mode
- `viewport <requestId>` — return interactive-window viewport bounds
- `gesture <requestId> <payloadBase64>` — inject a planned touch gesture (same payload as the
  one-shot `gesture` mode)
- `quit <requestId>` — acknowledge and stop the session

`viewport` and `gesture` responses are headers-only (no body): `kind`, `injectedEvents`,
`elapsedMs` for `gesture`, and `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` for `viewport`. `snapshot` responses carry
the XML body after the header block, as described below. The response protocol literal is always
`android-snapshot-helper-v1`, regardless of session or one-shot transport.

## Output Contract

The APK emits instrumentation status records using
`agentDeviceProtocol=android-snapshot-helper-v1`.

The XML node attributes intentionally mirror acquisition facts decoded by the host, including
`visible-to-user`, `drawing-order`, bounds, text/description/id, interaction booleans, and window
metadata on window roots. The helper emits `drawing-order` on Android API 24+ and omits it on API
23, where the platform API is unavailable. The host keeps that fact as private capture evidence;
the daemon uses it to annotate covered actions without adding it to normalized snapshot nodes.

Each XML chunk is sent with:

- `outputFormat=uiautomator-xml`
- `chunkIndex`
- `chunkCount`
- `payloadBase64`

The final instrumentation result for the default `snapshot` mode includes:

- `ok=true`
- `helperApiVersion=2`
- `waitForIdleTimeoutMs`
- `waitForIdleQuietMs`
- `timeoutMs`
- `maxDepth`
- `maxNodes`
- `rootPresent`
- `captureMode` (`interactive-windows` or `active-window`)
- `windowCount`
- `nodeCount`
- `truncated`
- `elapsedMs`

`viewport` and `gesture` one-shot results carry `agentDeviceProtocol`/`helperApiVersion`/
`outputFormat` plus the mode-specific fields described under "One-Shot Modes" above, instead of the
`snapshot`-mode fields listed here.

Failures return `ok=false`, `errorType`, and `message` in the final result.

The release manifest is a stable provider contract for the current helper protocol. Providers should
resolve the APK from `apkUrl`, verify `sha256`, install it with `adb install -r <apk>`, and run
`instrumentationRunner`. Manifests up to 0.21.3 also carried an `installArgs` array; it only ever
spelled `install -r` (plus `-t` while the helper was `testOnly`), so consumers can ignore it.
